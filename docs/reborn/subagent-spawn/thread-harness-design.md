# Subagent Thread Harness — Delivery & Durability Design

Status: accepted design — supersedes the 2026-06-08 durability spec and PR #5176's draft docs.

Scope: `crates/ironclaw_reborn`, `crates/ironclaw_loop_support`, `crates/ironclaw_turns`,
`crates/ironclaw_filesystem`, `crates/ironclaw_outbound`, `crates/ironclaw_reborn_composition`.

This is the canonical design for the subagent completion-delivery and durability
layer: how a parent thread is notified when a descendant subagent settles, how
that notification survives crashes and restarts, and how approval/auth gates
from any descendant reach a human. It **supersedes outright** the durability
design in the 2026-06-08 spec (`BoundedSubagentGateResolutionStore` +
SQL ledger/reconciler/idempotency-table approach) and the draft docs opened
under PR #5176 — no code from either survives beyond what §3 below marks
SURVIVES. This design was hardened through multiple rounds of adversarial
technical review against the live crates; every ruling cites the concrete
call sites, line numbers, and existing production patterns it verified
against.

Companion doc: `docs/reborn/subagent-spawn/README.md` is the overarching
subagent-spawn design (spawn mechanism, security model, blocking lifecycle).
This document is the canonical source for its background-mode delivery and
durability layer (README §7 "Background delivery" / §13 follow-ups — deferred
there pending this design, now settled here).

**Standing ruling — governs the whole document:** `spawn_subagent` is
deny-filtered in production today — no live behavior to preserve.
`SubagentSpawnDeps.gate_store` is **required**, not `Option`
(`crates/ironclaw_loop_support/src/subagent_spawn_port.rs:378`). **No
`subagent.v2_enabled` flag anywhere.** `disabled_capability_ids` is the sole
on/off gate.

## 0. Requirements

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Parent inspects a child's work anytime | `subagent_inspect`, §1, §7 (PR3) |
| 2 | Human opens child thread, keeps conversing | Console `activate(Human)`, §7 (PR5a/5b), §11 |
| 3 | Parent re-activates a finished child, no cold start | `subagent_extend` = `activate(ParentAgent)`, §6, §7 (PR4) |
| 4 | Best-in-class harness (Claude Code/Codex/LangGraph/Temporal/Devin/Assistants) | Whole design; §1 |
| 5 | Any descendant gate (approval/auth) reaches a human deterministically, any depth | §9 Gate propagation |
| 6 | Flavors configurable (prompt/capabilities/budget/model), no loop fork | §10 Per-flavor configurability |

## 1. Inherited core

- Child = normal Turn thread + lineage header (`parent_run_id`, `tree_root_run_id`, `depth`). Inspect/human-attach/re-activate are ordinary thread operations.
- One await-edge file per parent-awaits-child; CAS `open → settled → drained`, `open → abandoned`.
- Terminal is per-run; threads park, never die. `activate(thread, input, provenance)` is the single re-activation primitive; `ThreadBusy` if a run is live.
- Consent-to-wake: an agent wakes only its own direct live child; orphaned descendants are human-wake-only.
- Parent resume via `TurnStatus::BlockedDependentRun` + `gate:subagent-await-<child_run_id>` + `resume_turn` with `ResumeTurnPrecondition::BlockedDependentRunGate` (verified: `crates/ironclaw_turns/src/request.rs:33,48` maps this to `required_status() == Some(BlockedDependentRun)`).
- Child run record is the result source of truth (no `CapabilityResultStore`).
- Safety: child→parent framed-as-untrusted + byte-capped via `wrap_untrusted_subagent_text`; child→human raw; gates bubble up lineage (generalized in §9).
- **No flag.** `disabled_capability_ids` gates the capability.

## 2. Closed edges are deleted

CLAUDE.md: *"LLM data is never deleted... 'Cleanup' means evicting from in-memory caches, never deleting database rows."* Scoped to **model I/O** — transcripts, run records, events. The await-edge is control-plane delivery bookkeeping, not a record of what any LLM said or did. The child's run record, its lifecycle events, and the framed content the parent consumed (written at drain) are the durable facts — the edge is scaffolding for one-time delivery; once delivered it has no further job.

**Ruling: on CAS to `drained`, and on `abandoned` finalization, the edge file is deleted — via the new CAS-guarded `delete_if_version` (§4.0), never a blind delete.** `RootFilesystem::delete(path)` has **no CAS precondition** today (`crates/ironclaw_filesystem/src/root.rs:158` — no `CasExpectation` param, unlike `put`); §4.0 adds the missing primitive, closing the silent blind-delete gap this design corrects.

**Crash-ordering and self-healing.** Edge close is two durable steps: (1) CAS the edge's own state to its terminal value, (2) `delete_if_version(edge_path, Version(post-transition))`. **Order is fixed — state transition first, delete second** (deleting before the state CAS would make a live-looking edge vanish with no record of why). A crash between (1) and (2) leaves a **terminal-but-undeleted edge** on disk — **recovery (boot pass §4.3/§5.3, and the lazy backstop) must enumerate `drained`/`abandoned` edges the same way it enumerates open ones**, and re-run step (2); `NotFound`/`VersionMismatch` on that retry is itself benign (someone else finished it, or it's mid-handling) and reported `already_closed`. **This makes the orphan window self-healing by construction, not merely invisible** — recovery cost stays bounded, now also covering the terminal-but-undeleted window, not just true open/settled state.

**Consequences:** the per-parent live-index approach from earlier drafts is **deleted outright** (deletion gets there for free). No closed-root/archive language anywhere. Settled-but-undrained edges are the pending-delivery queue and are never deleted — only terminal transitions delete. `NotFound` on any edge read is benign — treat it like a completed settle-then-drain.

## 3. What this replaces

New code lives in `crates/ironclaw_reborn/src/subagent/await_edge/` (`mod.rs`, `store.rs`, `resolver.rs`, `roster.rs`). The new `AwaitEdgeResolver` owns settle/resume/drain/recovery end-to-end.

| DIES | Why |
|---|---|
| `BoundedSubagentGateResolutionStore` (`.../subagent/gate_resolution.rs`, **1,532 lines**) | Its job — in-memory gate bookkeeping for delivery — is what the CAS'd, durable edge file now does. |
| `DefaultPlannedRuntimeParts.subagent_gate_store` (`crates/ironclaw_reborn/src/runtime.rs:288`, reads `:524,618,657,668`) + construction/threading at `crates/ironclaw_reborn_composition/src/runtime.rs:3002` (`:3134,:3449`) | Replaced 1:1 by `Arc<dyn AwaitEdgeWriter>`, same required-not-`Option` shape (per the standing no-flag ruling above). |
| `completion_observer.rs` gate-store call sites (production cluster before test helpers at ~1077) | Split below by function. |
| `prompt_material.rs`'s gate read (`GateBackedSubagentPromptMaterialSource::material_for_run`, `.gate_store.subagent_kind_for_child(...)`, line 79) | **Dies outright.** Existing fallback (lines 82-90) already covers every case. |
| `BoundedSubagentResultTombstoneStore` (`tombstone_store.rs`, 119 lines) | **Verified already unwired** — dead code before this design. |
| `production_readiness.rs`'s `subagent_result_tombstone_store: RebornComponentReadiness` field (`crates/ironclaw_reborn/src/production_readiness.rs:362`, read `:384,455,761`) + regression test `production_readiness_rejects_non_durable_subagent_tombstone_store` (`tests/production_readiness.rs:152-156`) | Named explicitly — a readiness-graph field for a deleted component is not a partial deletion. |
| `AwaitedChildState`'s release-claim tri-state (`descendant_reservation_released`/`_release_claimed` fields + `claim_descendant_reservation_release`/`mark_descendant_reservation_released`/`release_descendant_reservation_claim`, `gate_resolution.rs:334-379`) | Dies with the store; **moves** to the `AwaitEdge` payload — §5.5. |
| `AwaitedChildSetRecord.{gate_ref, result_ref}`, `TurnRunRecord.gate_ref` | Path identity + `child_run_id` locator replace both (see §1). |

| SURVIVES | Reason |
|---|---|
| Spawn port + `SpawnTreeReservation` + flavors + goal store | Capacity admission, prompt flavor, goal text — no gate/edge coupling. |
| `completion_observer.rs`'s `TurnCommittedEventObserver` impl | **Non-delivery duty kept**: detects child terminal, calls `AwaitEdgeResolver::on_child_terminal(...)`. |
| `release_descendant_reservation` (line 425) | **Non-delivery duty kept**: capacity bookkeeping. Tri-state guard moves per §5.5. |
| `resume_parent`, `write_terminal_result`, `mark_child_deliveries`, `child_terminal_output`, `update_parent_result_reference`, `recover_missing_gate_record`, `reconstruct_record` | **Move into `AwaitEdgeResolver`** — re-homed onto the edge file. |

## 4.0 CAS-guarded delete primitive

PR1 merge blocker: **P1.0b**.

**Gap:** `RootFilesystem::delete` (`root.rs:158`) takes no `CasExpectation`, unlike `put`. Every backend's delete is unconditional: `in_memory.rs:142` (`state.entries.remove(path)`, no version compare), `libsql.rs:951` (`DELETE ... WHERE path = ?1 OR path LIKE ?2`, no version predicate), `postgres.rs:590`/`postgres_delete_with_client` (same shape). §2's edge-close and §4.5's roster-prune both need TOCTOU-safe delete; neither exists today.

**Ruling: add `delete_if_version(&self, path, expected: CasExpectation) -> Result<(), FilesystemError>` as a new, additive `RootFilesystem` method — not a signature change to `delete`.** `RootFilesystem::delete(path)` has ~20+ production call sites across unrelated subsystems (verified: `ironclaw_secrets`, `ironclaw_skills`, `ironclaw_outbound/src/filesystem_store.rs`, `ironclaw_threads/src/filesystem_service.rs`, `ironclaw_product_workflow/src/filesystem_ledger.rs`, `ironclaw_reborn_composition/{slack_setup,extension_lifecycle,bundled_skills,llm_key_store,product_auth_durable/*}.rs`, `ironclaw_resources/src/cas_snapshot.rs`, `ironclaw_reborn/src/subagent/goal_store.rs`, `ironclaw_approvals/src/capability_permission.rs`) — none need CAS, none should have their blind-delete semantics touched. Forcing a `CasExpectation` onto all of them is exactly the blast-radius churn this design avoids (`P1.0b` is scoped to await-edges/roster only).

**Error taxonomy is NOT inherited from `put` — it's a new, small diagnosis branch.** `put`'s `Version` arm never emits `NotFound` for an absent row: `postgres.rs`'s `diagnose_put_failure` (`postgres.rs:1362-1379`) and `libsql.rs`'s `Version(expected)` arm (`libsql.rs:299-306` — not the `Absent`-arm conflict branch at :262-267) both collapse "row absent" and "row present at wrong version" into the same `VersionMismatch{found: None}`; the in-memory `check_cas` helper (`in_memory.rs:487-506`) does the same — its `(CasExpectation::Version(expected), found)` catch-all arm returns `VersionMismatch{expected: Some(expected), found}` regardless of whether `found` is `None` (absent) or `Some` (wrong version). That collapse is correct for `put` (an absent row on write just means "create it"), but wrong for `delete_if_version`, where the caller needs to tell "already gone" (`NotFound`, benign per §2) apart from "gone stale, don't touch it" (`VersionMismatch`). **`delete_if_version` therefore implements its own two-branch diagnosis on the 0-rows/absent case, per backend: read current state first (or follow up a failed conditional delete with a read) — row absent → `NotFound`; row present at a different version → `VersionMismatch`.** This is new logic sized to the one new method, not a reuse of `put`'s diagnosis.

**Shape, per backend:**
- Default trait impl: `Unsupported`, same pattern as `put`'s default.
- `in_memory.rs` (new fn beside :134, the `delete` impl): look up the current version before removing — `None` → `NotFound`; `Some(v)` where `v != expected` → `VersionMismatch{expected, found: Some(v)}`; matching version → remove, no mutation on either error branch. Cannot reuse `check_cas` as-is (its catch-all arm doesn't distinguish absent from wrong-version, per above) — the two-branch check is written directly in the new fn.
- `libsql.rs` (new fn beside :951): `DELETE ... WHERE path = ?1 AND version = ?2` for `Version(v)`; 0 rows → a follow-up `SELECT version` distinguishes `NotFound` (no row) from `VersionMismatch` (row exists at a different version) — a new two-step diagnosis for this method, not the reused `put` shape. `Any` → today's unconditional predicate.
- `postgres.rs` (new fn beside :590): same `AND version = $2` addition, with its own follow-up `SELECT version` on 0-rows to distinguish `NotFound` from `VersionMismatch` — `version` column already exists, read by `put`/`query` (`postgres.rs:352,388-395,483-491`), but the diagnosis branch itself is new.
- `ScopedFilesystem` (new wrapper beside `delete` at `scoped.rs:526`): pure passthrough to `self.root.delete_if_version(...)`.
- `CompositeRootFilesystem` (new fn beside `delete` at `catalog.rs:360`): `self.matching_mount(path)?.backend.delete_if_version(path, expected)` — pure dispatch.
- **Out of scope:** `LocalFilesystem::delete` (`local.rs:354`) — `LocalFilesystem::put` already rejects `CasExpectation::Version` as `Unsupported` (`local.rs:201-206`, no per-path versioning), so it was never viable for CAS'd edges. `HsmBackend` (`hsm.rs:111`) is an in-tree placeholder, not production. `StorageTxn::delete` (`backend.rs:41`) is the separate multi-key-transaction mechanism; edges are single-key CAS-only ("Stores must always work with CAS... as the floor," `root.rs:33`) and never open a `StorageTxn` — unaffected.
- `CasExpectation::Absent` is not meaningful for delete (nothing to compare) — every edge/roster call site uses `Version` or `Any`.

**Consequences:** (a) **Edge close** = CAS state-to-terminal, then `delete_if_version(edge_path, Version(post-transition))` — ordering in §2. (b) **Roster prune** (§4.5) = boot reads the roster marker's current version at the instant it observes the scope's open-edge dir empty, then `delete_if_version(roster_path, Version(that_version))`. A concurrent spawn writing a new edge for that scope bumps the marker's version via its own idempotent-but-version-bumping upsert, so the prune's CAS fails with `VersionMismatch` and aborts — no TOCTOU loss of a roster entry newly needed.

**Residual race, closed by two symmetric compensating checks.** The version-bump guard above only catches a concurrent spawn whose roster upsert lands *before* prune's delete call; it does not catch a concurrent spawn whose first-edge write for that scope lands *after* prune's version read but whose roster upsert has not happened yet — prune's CAS still targets the version it read, still succeeds, and deletes a roster marker a new edge now needs. Two compensating checks close this, symmetric in time: **(i) spawn self-heal** — after writing the first edge for a scope, spawn re-reads the roster marker; `NotFound` triggers an idempotent re-put (`CasExpectation::Absent`; a `VersionMismatch` on that re-put means someone else already restored it, which is fine). **(ii) boot prune self-check** — immediately after a successful `delete_if_version` of a roster marker, boot re-lists that scope's open-edge dir; if it is now non-empty, boot restores the marker via the same idempotent re-put. The two checks are complementary in time — whichever of them runs later than the actual edge write is the one that observes and heals the stranded state, so every interleaving converges to a live roster entry; a subsequent boot pass sees a non-empty dir and never attempts the delete at all.

**Leaf-key note.** Edge and roster files are leaf keys with no children, so `delete`'s cascade semantics (the `... OR path LIKE ...` subtree sweep visible in `libsql.rs:951` and mirrored in the in-memory/postgres backends) are immaterial here — `delete_if_version` is pinned to single-key semantics only; it never needs subtree-delete behavior.

**Required tests (P1.0b) — crate-tier** (`RootFilesystem`/backend primitive, no production caller to drive through yet): dual-backend parity: (1) correct-version delete succeeds; (2) stale version → `VersionMismatch`, no mutation; (3) missing path → `NotFound`; (4) roster-prune-vs-concurrent-spawn race, split into (4a) and (4b) per the residual-race ruling above — (4a) version-mismatch abort: a concurrent version bump lands before prune's delete call → prune's CAS fails, roster entry survives untouched; (4b) CAS-delete-succeeds-but-edge-lands-anyway: the edge write lands after prune's version read but before its roster upsert → prune's delete succeeds, and the test asserts convergence to a restored roster entry via either compensating path (integration-tier, since (4b) exercises both spawn and boot in the same race window). **Until P1.0b lands, nothing else in PR1 merges** (sibling gate alongside P1.0, §4.4).

## 4. Blocker resolutions

**4.1 Crate placement — permanent seam.** `AwaitEdgeWriter`/`AwaitEdgeSettler` traits defined in `ironclaw_loop_support` (owns `SubagentSpawnDeps`); `FilesystemAwaitEdgeStore`/`AwaitEdgeResolver` in `ironclaw_reborn` implement both — dependency inversion, category 2 of `.claude/rules/type-placement.md`. `ironclaw_loop_support` cannot depend on `ironclaw_reborn`. Permanent, no `arch-exempt`.

**4.2 Canonical path.** `/turns/subagent-await-edges/<parent_run_id>/<child_run_id>.json` — one constant **alias, scope-relative** (§4.5a: the physical location this resolves to is per-scope-partitioned by the mount). Deleted (via `delete_if_version`, §4.0) on drain/abandon-final (§2).

**4.3 Boot-recovery driver: roster- and store-driven.** Enumerate the scope roster (§4.5), then per scope `list_parents_with_unclosed_edges(scope)` — a plain bounded, **scope-isolated** `list_dir` (§2, §4.5a — this only ever lists that one scope's mounted subtree), **plus** the terminal-but-undeleted sweep from §2's crash-ordering ruling. No `TurnStateStore` active-run query.

**4.4 #5466 owned, not deferred.** `docs/plans/2026-07-04-w6-cas-contention-plan.md` (verified) explicitly does **not** chase root cause: excludes `StorageMode::LibSql` "unconditionally until #5466's libsql diagnosis lands a real fix" (line 85); allow-list captioned "already-*observed* (NOT root-cause-diagnosed)" (line 125). Its own text (line 70) locates the defect in `FilesystemTurnStateStore::apply_with_retry`'s (now `cas_update`, `crates/ironclaw_turns/src/filesystem_store.rs:44,441`) lock-free CAS retry over a `RootFilesystem` — `SIGABRT`/`SQLITE_MISUSE` under concurrent CAS retries against libsql. **Ruling: PR1 includes P1.0, "root-cause + fix #5466 at the RootFilesystem/libsql layer," with the w6 plan's repro (16 children CAS-settling concurrently, one scope, 100 iterations, both backends) as falsifier + acceptance. PR1's merge gate is P1.0 (and P1.0b, §4.0) done** — not "upstream fixes it eventually."

**4.5 Scope roster + scope-key encoding.** Boot/lazy recovery needs which `(tenant, user, agent)` scopes have unclosed edges without a global walk (why a global walk isn't available at all: §4.5a). At first edge write for a scope, spawn idempotently writes a roster marker under `ResourceScope::system()` (`crates/ironclaw_host_api/src/resource.rs:28,112`; used this way by `ironclaw_conversations/src/filesystem_store.rs:203,237`, `ironclaw_reborn_composition/src/llm_key_store.rs:116`).

**Encoding reuses an existing precedent** — `crates/ironclaw_reborn/src/local_trigger_access/filesystem.rs:403-419` turns `(agent_id, project_id, user_id)` into a nested path-safe key. Roster reuses it: `/turns/subagent-await-scopes/tenants/<tenant>/users/<user>/agents/{some/<agent>|none}.json` — `tenant_id` in-path since the roster lives under the system sentinel, which the same resolver rewrites to the constant `__system__`/`__system__` target rather than a tenant-specific one — one predictable global tree, hence tenant must be encoded in the path itself (verified `ironclaw_reborn_composition/src/lib.rs:718-760`).

**Write ordering:** the roster marker is written **before** the first edge file for that scope, never after. A crash between the two leaves a roster **superset** — harmless, since boot finds an empty open-edge dir and the CAS'd prune (§4.0(b)) removes the stale entry next pass. The unsafe ordering (edge first, roster after) would let a crash hide a real open edge from boot recovery entirely — never chosen.

Boot enumerates the roster (`list_dir` on `/turns/subagent-await-scopes/`); lazy per-scope backstop (§5.3) stays as roster-miss safety net. **Dual-backend:** `list_dir` verified on all three backends — `postgres.rs:545`, `libsql.rs:910`, `in_memory.rs:170`.

**4.5a Scope-aware construction — no fixed-view.** The await-edge store and the scope roster are both built on the **same single shared `ScopedFilesystem` handle**, constructed *once* via `crate::wrap_scoped(root)` → `ScopedFilesystem::new(root, invocation_mount_view)` (`crates/ironclaw_reborn_composition/src/lib.rs:848-852`; resolver `invocation_mount_view` at `:753-763`, alias table `PER_USER_ALIASES` — including `/turns` — at `:718-733`) — **never** via `ScopedFilesystem::with_fixed_view`. Every op (`put`/`get`/`list_dir`/`delete_if_version`) takes the caller's live `ResourceScope` as an explicit argument (`scoped.rs:216-233,487,526`); the resolver recomputes the `MountView` for *that* scope on *that* call. This is the same pattern already load-bearing in production for `ironclaw_conversations::filesystem_store` (`.get(&scope, &path)` / `.put`, re-evaluating a fresh scope per call at `filesystem_store.rs:205,238`) and `ironclaw_reborn_composition::llm_key_store` (`store.put(scope(), ...)`, `scope()` re-evaluated per call at `llm_key_store.rs:39,115-116`) — neither constructs a filesystem baked to one scope.

**Anti-pattern, named explicitly:** `owner_turn_state_filesystem` (`crates/ironclaw_reborn_composition/src/factory.rs:1927-1938`, used in production at `:2079,:4314`) builds a **`ScopedFilesystem::with_fixed_view`** baked to a single `owner_scope` at composition time — a single-boot-owner view. That is the exact bug class behind #5720/#5721 (per-user `/turns` state collapses onto one owner on multi-user boxes). **New await-edge/roster code must not copy this constructor** — it must be built the `wrap_scoped`/`invocation_mount_view` way: one process-wide handle, scope threaded per call, never per-scope-baked at construction. (The only other `with_fixed_view` hit under `subagent/` — `factory.rs:5011`'s `subagent_goal_filesystem` — is test-only fixture code inside `mod tests` opening at line 4647; production's goal store at `factory.rs:2232` is correctly built via `wrap_scoped`.)

**Consequence — §4.2's canonical path is scope-relative, not scope-agnostic.** `/turns/subagent-await-edges/<parent_run_id>/<child_run_id>.json` is a `ScopedPath` alias; the physical `VirtualPath` it resolves to is `/tenants/<tenant>/users/<user>/turns/subagent-await-edges/<parent_run_id>/<child_run_id>.json` (`/turns` is tenant/user-rewritten — it is one of the `PER_USER_ALIASES`). Two different scopes' edges for the *same* `parent_run_id`/`child_run_id` pair therefore land in physically distinct trees on the backend. That is what makes `list_parents_with_unclosed_edges(scope)` (§4.3) a plain, bounded, **scope-isolated** `list_dir(&scope, "/turns/subagent-await-edges")`: it only ever lists that one scope's mounted subtree, never a global one. The scope roster (§4.5) exists precisely because that isolation means boot cannot discover *which* scopes have edges without a scope-agnostic index — the roster marker (itself written under the system sentinel scope, so its own listing genuinely *is* global) is what tells boot which real scopes to mount-and-walk one at a time.

**Acceptance test (folds into P1.6a/P1.6c) — integration-tier** (drives the real composed `ScopedFilesystem`/`invocation_mount_view` stack): write an await-edge for two different `ResourceScope`s (different `user_id`; same or different `tenant_id`) using the same `parent_run_id`/`child_run_id`, then assert — read back at the filesystem layer, not just via two `ScopedFilesystem` calls that could coincidentally agree — that the two writes landed at two distinct physical paths (`/tenants/<A>/users/<A>/turns/...` vs `/tenants/<B>/users/<B>/turns/...`).

**4.6 Module placement.** `crates/ironclaw_reborn/src/subagent/await_edge/` — not appended to `completion_observer.rs` (**4,685 lines**, already over the 1,500-line budget in `.claude/rules/architecture.md` §5). Only edit to that file beyond §3's extraction: `wrap_untrusted_subagent_text` → `pub(crate)`.

## 5. Core delivery mechanics

The following are carried forward unchanged from the prior durability-design lineage (restated here so this doc is self-contained; §5.5 and §5.6 are new).

**5.1 Capacity: reservation is the cap, listing advisory.** Unchanged. `SpawnTreeReservation` (depth ≤ 1, ≤ 4 spawns/turn, ≤ 16 descendants/tree) is the sole admission mechanism.

**5.2 Two-layer exactly-once, `InvalidTransition` discriminator.** Layer 1: CAS single-winner per transition. Layer 2: `resume_turn`'s durable idempotency replay (`crates/ironclaw_turns/src/memory/mod.rs:187,1031-1046,2248-2269`, CAS'd in the same snapshot as every run-state transition). No `resume_dispatched_at` field needed.

**Boot/drain contract, matched on `from` — no wildcard.** `resume_turn_once` (`memory/mod.rs:2363-2384`) sets `from: record.status.get()` when `BlockedDependentRunGate`'s required status (`BlockedDependentRun`, `request.rs:48`) mismatches, raising `InvalidTransition{from, to: Queued}`.

- **Benign `already_closed`:** `from ∈ {Queued, Running, Completed}`.
- **`ResolveReport.failed`, surfaced:** everything else. No wildcard match.

Required tests (**P1.3**), crate-tier (`InvalidTransition` discriminator + CAS layer are pure state-machine logic, no external seam to drive through): (a) double-settle race → one resume; (b) crash-after-settle-before-resume → one resume via durable idempotency key; (c) crash-after-resume-before-drain → `InvalidTransition{from: Queued|Running}`-as-`already_closed` lets drain complete without a second resume.

**5.3 Boot enumeration: roster-driven + lazy backstop.** Eager: background boot task walks roster (§4.5), resolves unclosed edges per scope, never blocks foreground. Lazy: a spawn/activate against an unbooted scope triggers a one-shot scoped resolve first (`in_progress` guard).

**5.4 Observability.** `ResolveReport { resumed, drained, abandoned, already_closed, failed }` per scope, `debug!` + counters. Under §2, `drained`/`abandoned` now mean "resumed/finalized **and the edge file deleted**." `failed > 0` is actionable. `ironclaw-reborn subagent edges [--scope …]` lists unclosed edges off the roster. **Terminal byte-length accounting:** today's `AwaitedChildState.terminal_byte_len` (`gate_resolution.rs:27`) is set by `record_terminal_byte_len` (`:186-198`) as a best-effort **second** write *after* `mark_terminal_result_written` in `write_terminal_result` (`completion_observer.rs:497-518`) — **moves onto the edge as an additive `terminal_byte_len: Option<u64>` field, set in the same CAS write that transitions the edge to terminal.** Strictly better than today (folds two mutations that could drift into one atomic write). Still feeds `ByteCapStrategy` observability only, never durability — a missing value is logged at `debug!` and never blocks delivery.

## 5.5 Descendant-reservation release tri-state on the edge

**Gap:** the single-winner release guard for `SpawnTreeReservation` capacity lives entirely on the dying store — `descendant_reservation_released` / `descendant_reservation_release_claimed` fields plus `claim_descendant_reservation_release`/`mark_descendant_reservation_released`/`release_descendant_reservation_claim` (`gate_resolution.rs:334-379`, exact range). §3's replacement inventory lists this as "surviving" logic without saying where its state lives once the store dies — this section closes that gap.

**Ruling: the tri-state moves onto the `AwaitEdge`'s own state payload, CAS'd like every other transition — no separate store, no new file.** Add `reservation_release: ReservationReleaseState` (`Unclaimed | Claimed | Released`):
- `Unclaimed → Claimed`: CAS'd (`CasExpectation::Version(edge_version)`) exactly like today's in-memory check-then-set; only the CAS winner releases `SpawnTreeReservation` capacity.
- `Claimed → Released`: CAS'd after the capacity-release call succeeds, mirroring `mark_descendant_reservation_released`.
- A failed release attempt CAS's back `Claimed → Unclaimed`, mirroring `release_descendant_reservation_claim`'s retry-unlock, so a transient failure doesn't permanently strand the reservation.

Lives on the **same edge file** as settle/drain state — one more field, one more CAS'd path, not a second file — so it's deleted with the edge on drain/abandon (§2).

**Boot recovery also owns the claim-but-not-yet-released window.** An edge that crashed between the `Unclaimed → Claimed` CAS and the capacity-release call — i.e. scanned during recovery and found sitting in `Claimed` — is retried by the same boot/lazy recovery pass (§4.3/§5.3) that resolves every other unclosed edge; the `Claimed → Released` (or its failure-path retry-unlock back to `Unclaimed`) is just another CAS attempt the recovery walk makes, no special-cased recovery path needed.

**Required test (P1.9 extension), crate-tier:** (a) double-release race — two concurrent resolver instances (crash-retry racing a fresh recovery pass) both attempt to release the same child's reservation; assert capacity is released **exactly once** (the loser's `Unclaimed → Claimed` CAS fails, observes `Claimed`/`Released` already, no-ops); (b) boot-recovery-retries-`Claimed` — seed an edge already at `Claimed` (simulating the crash window above), run a recovery pass, assert it drives the edge to `Released` (or retry-unlocks to `Unclaimed` on a simulated release failure) rather than leaving it stuck.

## 5.6 `AwaitEdge` payload — assembled

One struct, one file per parent↔child, fields previously scattered across §2/§4.2/§5.4/§5.5:

```
AwaitEdge {
  child_scope: TurnScope,                          // §1
  child_thread_id: ThreadId,
  mode: SubagentSpawnMode,                         // Blocking | Background
  state: AwaitEdgeState,                           // Open | Settled | Drained | Abandoned (§2)
  terminal_kind: Option<EdgeTerminalKind>,         // set in the settle CAS
  terminal_byte_len: Option<u64>,                  // §5.4 — same settle CAS, observability only
  reservation_release: ReservationReleaseState,    // §5.5 — Unclaimed | Claimed | Released
  created_at, settled_at: Option<...>,             // stamps
}
```

Identity (`parent_run_id`, `child_run_id`) lives in the path, not the payload (§4.2). `Drained`/`Abandoned`-final edges are deleted (§2), so terminal states are transient on disk — the durable terminal facts live on the child's run record.

## 6. Run-budget floor (derived, not stored)

Cap: **8 consecutive `ParentAgent`-provenance activations per thread.** `Human` resets to 0, never capped. 9th consecutive `ParentAgent` → `subagent_extend_budget_exhausted`, sanitized, no internal identifiers cross the model-visible boundary.

**Counter — derived at `activate()`, not stored.** `SessionThreadRecord.metadata_json` (`crates/ironclaw_threads/src/contract.rs:184`) has **no mutation path**. Instead: `TurnRunRecord` gets one additive field, `subagent_activation_provenance: Option<ActivationProvenance>` (`ActivationProvenance { Human, ParentAgent, System }` — `System` is §8's background-wake provenance) set once at run creation, immutable thereafter.

`activate()` derives the cap walking the thread's run records newest-first: `System` runs skipped; `Human` stops the walk at 0; each `ParentAgent` increments; reaching 8 before a `Human` run or history's start refuses the 9th.

Unchanged: per-child SUBAGENT budget (`iteration_limit` 16, made per-flavor-overridable in §10); `SpawnTreeReservation` cap (16), depth cap (1, depth-agnostic per §9/§10).

## 7. Functionality staging

| PR | Ships | Gate |
|----|-------|------|
| 1 | edge store + resolver + scope roster + boot/lazy recovery + **CAS-guarded delete (P1.0b, §4.0)** + depth floor + `wrap_untrusted_subagent_text` promotion + **P1.0: #5466 fix** + exactly-once + scope-isolation + **descendant-reservation tri-state (§5.5)** tests — **replaces** gate-store delivery outright (blocking only) | P1.0 + P1.0b done; all tests green both backends |
| 2 | background mode + activate-on-settle for parked/completed parents (§8) + `ResolveReport` counters + operator `edges` command + **gate-propagation escalation walk, moved up from PR6 (§9, P2.5/P2.6)** | PR1 soaked; integration matrix green; gate-walk tests green |
| 3 | `subagent_inspect` (metadata-only) + per-flavor budget plumbing (P3.2, §10c) | — |
| 4 | `subagent_extend` (`activate` + `ParentAgent` + consent-to-wake + budget, §6) | — |
| 5a | `GET /api/webchat/v2/threads/{thread_id}/children` (lineage projection, no new store) | ~0.5 day |
| 5b | `ThreadTree` sidebar + raw-vs-framed display rule (§11) | ~1.5-2 days |
| 6 | `subagent_cancel` | security review |

**Gate-coverage window.** §9's escalation walk is now a **prod-enable gate**, not a PR6 afterthought — it ships with PR2, before `spawn_subagent` is ever cleared from `disabled_capability_ids`. During PR1 alone (blocking-only), a descendant's `BlockedApproval`/`BlockedAuth` has **no escalation** yet — the harness-only-phase inherited behavior: per §1, "child = normal Turn thread... ordinary thread operations," so the gate surfaces exactly the way **any** blocked thread's gate does today — via the existing origin-agnostic gate projection (`ironclaw_event_projections::PendingGateProjection`, `crates/ironclaw_event_projections/src/pending_gate_projection.rs`) and per-thread approval service (`crates/ironclaw_product_workflow/src/approval_interaction/service.rs`), neither new for subagents. The gap during this window is **discoverability, not resolvability**: a human must directly inspect/attach to the child thread (available from PR1 via §1, ahead of PR3 formalizing `subagent_inspect`) rather than being paged at the root automatically. Since `spawn_subagent` stays deny-filtered through PR1 regardless (the standing no-flag ruling), this window is unreachable in production — it only constrains what PR1's own tests may assume.

Prod enable: clear `builtin.spawn_subagent` from `disabled_capability_ids` after PR2 (now including the gate-escalation walk), e2e un-ignored, matrix green. No flag. **The e2e un-ignore task itself is integration-tier by definition** (`tests/e2e/`) — it is the end-to-end prod-enable gate, not a substitute for the crate/integration tests above.

## 8. Background delivery = activate

`PostCapabilityStage::drain_settled` (`crates/ironclaw_agent_loop/src/executor/post_capability.rs:36-37`) is **a permanent no-op stub today, not existing behavior to preserve** — it unconditionally `Vec::new()`s. Its doc comment names `LoopBackgroundChildPort` as the replacement; that type **does not exist anywhere in `crates/`** — verified, it is prose only in `docs/reborn/2026-06-04-subagent-compaction-design.md` (lines 66,83-84,180,275-287,322) plus a doc-comment pointer (#4474). Also verified: `PostCapabilityStage::process` runs on **every** `TurnCompletedStep::Continue` (`post_capability.rs:60-99`) — every non-exiting loop iteration, including a freshly-activated run's first (AssistantReply turns "reach here with an empty map" per the existing comment) — a fact §8.2 relies on.

**Ruling: `drain_settled` is NEWLY IMPLEMENTED by an owned PR2 task (P2.4) wiring it to `AwaitEdgeResolver` — list settled edges for the live parent, drain each. This supersedes the #4474 stub contract; no `LoopBackgroundChildPort` is ever built.**
- **Live parent:** `drain_settled` drains each iteration (P2.4).
- **Parked/completed parent:** on child settle, resolver calls `activate(parent_thread, input, provenance=System)`. `ThreadBusy` is a benign no-op — edge stays `settled`; §8.2's retry set picks it back up. `System` activations are exempt from §6's cap, bounded to **one** attempt per settled child — the edge's `settled` state is the dedupe.

**8.1 Drain-append idempotency.** The framed-content write into the parent — `update_parent_result_reference` → `update_tool_result_reference` (`crates/ironclaw_threads/src/filesystem_service.rs:1965-2013`) — is a **CAS-guarded in-place field update on an already-existing message**, not an append: it rescans for the tool-result-reference message (`matches_tool_result_reference`) then rewrites its `content` via `apply_message_update`'s CAS-retry closure. Calling it twice with the same `result_ref`/`safe_summary` reproduces the same `content` — **already idempotent by construction**, verified not asserted. The payload write it follows (`update_capability_result`, from `write_terminal_result`, `completion_observer.rs:494-518`) is guarded today by the in-memory `terminal_result_written` flag; under the edge design that guard **becomes the edge's own CAS state** (write payload once per `settled`→`drained` transition — a crash before that CAS just retries the whole flow, safe precisely because the transcript write is an overwrite, not an append). **Required test — integration-tier** (`tests/integration/`; drives the drain path through the real `AwaitEdgeResolver` + thread service, asserting at the transcript-message seam per `.claude/rules/testing.md`, part of P2.4's acceptance): crash after the transcript field-write but before the edge's CAS to `drained` → recovery replays the equivalent write → assert exactly one tool-result-reference message for that `result_ref`, content unchanged by the replay.

**8.2 System-activate retry set.** A settled edge for a parked/live parent is drained by exactly three independent triggers:
1. **Settle-time** `activate(..., System)` attempt (above) — may lose to `ThreadBusy` mid-run.
2. **Every run-start sweep** — `PostCapabilityStage::process` runs on every `Continue`, including a fresh run's first iteration, so the *next* time this thread runs for **any** reason, `drain_settled` (P2.4) picks up every still-settled edge as a side effect of that run happening at all.
3. **Boot pass** (§4.3/§5.3) — roster-driven, independent of any thread activating.

**Invariant:** a `ThreadBusy` at settle-time (trigger 1) is always healed by trigger 2 or 3 — a settled edge can never go permanently undrained while its parent thread ever runs again or a boot pass ever occurs. **Required test — integration-tier** (`tests/integration/`, same P2.4 acceptance as §8.1, driven through the live parent thread + boot-pass harness, not the resolver in isolation): settle a child mid-parent-run (forcing `ThreadBusy` on trigger 1); assert no further `System` attempt (dedup by `settled` state); then either (a) let the live run's next iteration drain it (trigger 2), or (b) run a boot pass and assert the roster sweep does (trigger 3).

## 9. Gate propagation — approval and auth, always to the tree root

Any gate from any descendant, any depth, bubbles to the **tree root's** originating human surface. Covers **auth/credential gates** (`BlockedAuth`) too, not just approvals. **Surfacing is always the tree root's originating surface**; an intermediate console may reference a pending gate but never resolves it.

**Both kinds, one shape — no new gate representation.** `TurnBlockedGateMetadata` (`crates/ironclaw_turns/src/events.rs:59-66`) already carries `gate_kind: TurnBlockedGateKind` (`Approval`, `Auth`, `Resource`, `AwaitDependentRun`, `ExternalTool`) plus `credential_requirements`. The walk is generic over `gate_kind`.

**9.1 Root-delivery-surface resolution, field-by-field.** The root's `source_binding_ref` is **not** unconditionally the delivery surface — this breaks for triggered origins. Resolution chain, reusing existing production machinery instead of inventing a fallback: `ironclaw_outbound`'s `resolve_run_notification_context` (`crates/ironclaw_outbound/src/resolution_engine.rs:59-95`) already dispatches on `RunNotificationOrigin` (`.../delivery_resolution.rs:137-151`):
- **`LiveSourceRoute { source_route }`** → `source_route.reply_target_binding_ref` verbatim (`:73-75`). Covers **interactive chat and live Slack**: the root's `TurnRunRecord.reply_target_binding_ref` (`ironclaw_turns/src/store.rs:160,171`) genuinely identifies a real conversation.
- **`Triggered { trigger }`** → `resolve_triggered_target(scope, actor, kind)` (`:76,119-137`), which for `ApprovalPrompt` calls `load_preference_target(scope, actor, PreferenceTargetKind::ApprovalPrompt)` — resolved from `TurnScope.explicit_owner_user_id()` (the trigger creator) via the owner's outbound preference, **bypassing `reply_target_binding_ref` entirely.** Every trigger fire's binding is synthesized against the canonical `TRIGGER_TRUSTED_ADAPTER_KIND = "trigger"` adapter (`crates/ironclaw_triggers/src/trusted_submit.rs:3,33-41`; predicate `is_trusted_trigger_adapter_kind`, "the trigger-owned authority," lines 7-13) — never a live channel — so a triggered root's binding refs are unconditionally non-actionable, not "sometimes." (Note: `SourceBindingRef::new("trusted-trigger-outcome-source")` at `ironclaw_conversations/src/inbound.rs:1053` is a **unit-test fixture** inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` opening at line 529, not a production value — the real non-actionable value is the `"trigger"` adapter binding above.)
- **`TriggeredFromSourceRoute { trigger, source_route }`** → hybrid path for a triggered fire with a genuine source route too (`:78-86`).
- **`SystemEvent { reason }`** → `NoDelivery` (`:87-89`).

**Origin classification** reuses the existing predicate `is_automation_trigger_thread` (`crates/ironclaw_product_workflow/src/reborn_services.rs:4727-4737`, parses `SessionThreadRecord.metadata_json`) — no new classifier.

**Ruling:** the walk's root-delivery step builds a `RunNotificationContext`/`CommunicationDeliveryIntent::RunNotification` for the tree root (root's `TurnScope` + classification above) and delegates to this **existing** engine — it does not read `source_binding_ref` directly, and invents no second fallback.

**Named integration gap (not hand-waved):** today's triggered-run delivery poller (`SlackFinalReplyDeliveryServices`/`deliver_triggered_run`, `crates/ironclaw_reborn_composition/src/slack_delivery.rs:2033`, feature `slack-v2-host-beta`) watches the **root run's own** status for `BlockedApproval`/`BlockedAuth` (`notification_for_actionable_state`, `:395-460`). Under this design a gate parks the **descendant**, not the root — the root sits at `BlockedDependentRun` (§5.2), so this poller would miss the gate entirely. **P2.5/P2.6 (§7) own extending it (or a successor) to accept the walk's resolved gating-run id/kind/gate_ref, not just observe the root run it already tracks** — a real required wiring change, not a pre-existing behavior to lean on unmodified.

**Auth identity — no new resolver.** `RuntimeCredentialAuthRequirement.requester_extension: ExtensionId` (`crates/ironclaw_host_api/src/decision.rs:106-113`) is already typed on the gate metadata the walk forwards verbatim.

**Required tests (P2.5/P2.6) — integration-tier** (`tests/integration/`; the walk, root-routing, and the Slack poller extension above all cross the descendant→root→delivery-surface seam, not a single-function unit): the depth-agnostic walk resolving a descendant gate to the tree root's delivery surface for each `RunNotificationOrigin` branch (§9.1), and the extended triggered-run delivery poller (`deliver_triggered_run`, above) picking up the walk's resolved gating-run id/kind/gate_ref instead of only the root run's own status.

**Mechanics — depth-agnostic:**
1. The gating run parks. No ancestor run touched.
2. Resolver walks `parent_run_id` upward: skip terminal runs, stop at the run whose `parent_run_id` is `None` — the root.
3. §9.1's resolution engine picks the delivery target from the root's scope + origin.
4. Resolution flows back down: the surface's decision resolves the **gating run itself** — not the root run.
5. An `abandoned` (deleted, §2) edge along the chain doesn't break the walk — lineage lives on the immutable run record.

## 10. Per-flavor configurability — flavors are data, the loop is shared

All 4 launch flavors (`SubagentFlavorId::{General, Explorer, Coder, Planner}`, `crates/ironclaw_reborn/src/subagent/flavors.rs:9-16`) run the **same** loop machinery — one `LoopFamily` (`LoopFamilyId::SUBAGENT`, `crates/ironclaw_agent_loop/src/families/subagent.rs`). **A flavor is config, not a fork.**

**(a) Prompt — already file-sourced.** `.../subagent/directions/{general,explorer,coder,planner}.md` via `include_str!()` (`directions/mod.rs:22-25`). No change.

**(b) Capability allow/deny — reuses existing machinery.** `SubagentCapabilitySurfaceResolver::resolve` (`.../subagent/capability_surface.rs:30-46`) computes `intersect_allow_sets(base, flavor_allowlist)`; deny layered outermost by `CapabilitySurfaceDenyFilter` (`ironclaw_loop_support/src/capability_surface_filter.rs:174-195`). Nothing new.

**(c) Budget — the one real gap, currently family-wide.** `SUBAGENT_ITERATION_LIMIT = 16` (`.../families/subagent.rs:9`) baked into `DefaultBudgetStrategy` (`:37-41`). **Ruling:** add `iteration_limit: u32` to `SubagentFlavor` (default 16), read at `material_for_run` — family default stays fallback (**P3.2**).

**(d) Model override — same pattern as (c).** `resolved_model_route` already overrides `DefaultModelStrategy` per run. `SubagentFlavor.model_override: Option<ModelRouteId>` feeds the same resolution (**P3.3**).

**Flavor schema (additive for future custom flavors):**
```
SubagentFlavor {
  id: SubagentFlavorId,
  direction: DirectionId,              // (a) unchanged
  tool_allowlist: &[SubagentToolId],   // (b) unchanged
  iteration_limit: u32,                // (c) NEW, default 16
  model_override: Option<ModelRouteId>,// (d) NEW, default None
  allow_nesting: bool,                 // unchanged
  summary: &str,                       // unchanged
}
```

## 11. WebUI scoping & extensibility

**PR5 WebUI.** `GET /api/webchat/v2/threads/{thread_id}/children` (lineage read projection, no new store) + `ThreadTree` sidebar. **Authorization:** the endpoint resolves the parent thread through the caller's authenticated scope, using the same owner-bound `TurnScope` resolution every other webchat v2 thread-read endpoint uses; an unauthorized or unknown `thread_id` collapses to the same not-found response as those reads (no existence oracle), and the returned children are filtered to that same resolved scope. Display rule: opening a child directly shows the raw transcript (§1); a "what did my subagent do" parent-agent-framed view shows only the framed + byte-capped edge content. **Required test (P5.2) — integration-tier** (`tests/integration/`; the endpoint is a real HTTP seam over live lineage data): the children endpoint returns the correct lineage projection for a thread with settled/drained/parked descendants; a cross-user request for another caller's thread returns not-found, with no lineage leaked.

Extensibility (unchanged): fork-on-extend, structured child→parent output schema, cross-agent shared memory, per-token budgets, tool attenuation at depth, `ARCHIVED` state + GC, file-discovered custom flavors — named deferrals, no code today.

## 12. What this design deliberately does NOT do

- No SQL tables, ledger, reconciler phases, dual-dialect DDL.
- **No semantic injection scanning of child output** — the equivalent-control posture is untrusted framing (`wrap_untrusted_subagent_text`) + the byte cap (§5.4) + gate-driven approval-bubbling to a human (§9) as the catastrophe backstop, not a scan. The unscanned-ingress gap this implies is platform-wide and pre-existing — Reborn's `submit_turn` ingress has no `SafetyLayer` wiring today for any caller, not something this design introduces for subagents specifically. When Reborn-wide `SafetyLayer` ingress wiring lands, the child→parent drain write adopts that same scan point like every other model-bound input — no bespoke subagent scanner — and that follow-up's scope must explicitly list the drain path as one of the ingress points it covers.
- No auto-cancel of orphans.
- No new crate; no feature flag.
- **No separate live-index/archive layer for closed edges (§2).**
- **No gate expiry timers.**
- **No multi-node/HA correctness claims.**
- **No signature change to `RootFilesystem::delete`** — the CAS primitive is additive (`delete_if_version`, §4.0), avoiding a ~20-call-site blast radius.
- **Tripwires (flip these rulings if hit):** (1) #5466 turns out structural to CAS-over-libsql, not fixable at the RootFilesystem layer; (2) a scope's roster directory becomes pathological to `list_dir` — shard by tenant; (3) any scope's *open* edge count grows large enough that admission-time `list_dir` is measurably slow — one CAS'd count file; (4) depth cap raised above 1 and §8/§6 need more than the limits knob.

## 13. Design→Plan cross-map

**Self-contained.** Every task id below has its files-touched + acceptance defined inline in the referenced section — this table is a locator, not the source of truth. The implementation plan this design feeds (tracked under `docs/plans/`, not committed to source) is retasked from this design end-to-end as its first deliverable, **P0.0**: drop any flag-centric framing carried over from earlier drafts, retask against P1.0-P6.x below, delete any leftover flag-setup tasks. No task ID depends on a prior plan draft surviving.
