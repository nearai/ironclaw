1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 I'm going to show you exactly how I'm using Open Claw. I have spent countless hours over the

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,600
 last few weeks exploring every nook and cranny of what is possible with Open Claw. I truly believe

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,680
 I am one of the most advanced users of Open Claw on the planet and I'm going to show you

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,480
 everything that I've learned. And it all starts right here. This is a fresh MacBook Air. I wiped

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,680
 it clean and I installed Open Claw on it. This thing lives right on my desk. I have it in clamshell

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,560
 mode. So when I close it, it does not shut off. It is running 24 hours a day connected to the

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,800
 internet and I make it easily available anywhere. I installed Team Viewer on it so that if I'm remote

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,360
 and something happens and I need to change something directly on the computer, I just Team Viewer

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,760
 into it and I can do that. I also set up tail scale so I can easily SSH into it. So if I want

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,240
 to code something with cursor on it, I can SSH in from any other computer and that one just sits

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,160
 on my desk. Here is the high level overview of everything going on in my system. And I know it

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,520
 looks complicated. I'm going to get into detail about all of it. All right. So here's the overview.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,040
 First, we have the interfaces. This is how I'm actually talking to my Open Claw. I use Telegram

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,560
 as the primary one. And if you watch my previous video, you know, I'm using Telegram groups. I have

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,320
 a bunch of different topics. I keep all of the topics very narrow, very niche and I actually don't

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,200
 have it start new sessions anymore. Previously, a default setting in Open Claw is to start a new

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
 session every day at like 4 a.m. That means it basically forgot everything in the chat prior,

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,600
 which would make sense if I had a single DM that spanned forever. But instead, I have all of these

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,160
 individual channels. So I didn't want to do that anymore. And the solution, I simply had it set

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,360
 the expiration of a session to be one year. And so look at all these different sessions. I have my

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,480
 knowledge base, my food journal, chron updates, video research, self improvement, business analysis,

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,240
 meeting prep, all of these different ones. And it allows me to stay on topic. All right. So now

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,640
 back here. Second, I have Slack, but I have it very narrowly implemented in Slack. It's only available

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,840
 in two channels. And it's only available to me. I am the only one who's able to invoke my Open Claw.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,160
 If somebody else tries to invoke it, it just ignores it. Then of course, we have our command

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,960
 line interface. I sometimes SSH in, and we also have scripts. I'm using multiple models, of course.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,240
 So we have anthropic opus, sonnet and haiku. I'm using Google Gemini for a bunch of stuff. We're

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,520
 using X AI, grok, and X search. And of course, we're using open AI. And it already has, after just two

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,760
 plus weeks of using it, a ton of different skills. I use it as a personal CRM. I use it as a knowledge

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,200
 base, a video idea pipeline, X and Twitter research, business meta analysis. That's a crazy one. Wait

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,040
 till I tell you about that hub spot ops. I always apply the humanizer skill. I want all the text

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,360
 coming out of it to be human like not AI like no M dashes. I plugged it into my to do list. And I

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,000
 kind of use it as a task management system as well. I track all of the usage across everything I do.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,040
 And of course, I use it for YouTube analytics. And I'm also storing a ton of data. I actually try to

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,480
 store all the data I possibly can. And I usually do that in a traditional database, mixed with a

36
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,840
 vector column. So I want to be able to do traditional SQL searches, but I also want to be able to do

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,160
 natural language searches using the vector column. And so I created a standardized way of creating

38
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,480
 this hybrid database. And I use it across a bunch of different skills. So I have my contacts in my

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,720
 CRM. Again, I'm going to go over all of these use cases. So I have my knowledge base. I have video

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,840
 pitches, my business meta analysis, views of my social channels, the cron log, everything is stored.

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,960
 Then I've plugged in a bunch of different external services. We have Google workspace via GOG. I have

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,320
 Asana, I have HubSpot, I have to do is fathom brave and GitHub. I have X, I have YouTube's API.

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,840
 So much is happening right now. And by the way, a quick shout out to the sponsor of this video

44
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,960
 Greptile. I use Greptile to review all the code that I'm putting out for open claw. And it's a lot.

45
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,680
 And it catches bugs that I wouldn't have seen that even Opus or GPT 5.3 codecs wouldn't have seen.

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,440
 And it's just a great system to really shore up all of the rough edges of my open claw instance.

47
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,880
 These guys at Greptile spend all of their time thinking about code review. And it helps me and

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,840
 my team save a bunch of time. It's used by some of the most popular repos in the world,

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,240
 including open claw, Nvidia, PyTorch, post talk storybook, and many more. Don't waste your

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,200
 team's time on code review, but code review is still critically important. Let Greptile do it.

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,640
 Try Greptile for free for 14 days. I'll drop a link down below. They've been a fantastic partner.

53
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,120
 All right. So the first workflow I want to talk about is my personal CRM. It is incredible because

54
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,000
 it allows me to plug in all of this built up knowledge into everything else I'm doing. Let me

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,200
 just explain. So I basically have my open claw download all of my emails and start to parse through

56
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,680
 them. Understand who's the email from filter out contacts that I don't want saved like newsletters

57
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
 and cold outreach, cold pitches. And then it finds the highest quality contacts and starts

58
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,720
 saving it to my CRM. It reads all of the downloaded emails, builds out a graph, builds out an understanding

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,000
 of all the conversations I've had with each contact and starts to save that in the database.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,040
 And I have it do that every single day. So it's always up to date. It always knows who I'm talking

61
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,400
 to, what I'm talking about. And it's just super helpful because I can always ask questions like,

62
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,360
 who is the last person I talked to at Greptile? And what did we talk about? Or who else do I know

63
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,720
 it? You know, this other company. And so this is how it works. I have the daily ingestion trigger,

64
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
 which is a cron job. It downloads Gmail and my calendar, by the way, not just Gmail, also my

65
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,520
 calendar. It extracts people from the senders and participants. It deduplicates everything,

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,720
 merges contact records. It uses AI to classify the role in context. And I use a very inexpensive,

67
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,800
 very fast Gemini 2.5 flash model, I believe, to do that classification. Then we start to update

68
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
 the timeline in last touch. It does semantic indexing. And it sends me updates via Telegram

69
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,880
 when I want it. And I can also just query against it, as I said earlier. Now where this is also very

70
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,920
 useful is in my meeting prep workflow. Every single day, first thing in the morning, it looks at my

71
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,760
 calendar for the day. It filters out events that don't have anybody or only have my internal team.

72
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,520
 And it basically gives me a meeting prep for the day. It says, Hey, you're meeting with this person.

73
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,280
 Here's the last thing you talked about. Here's what they want to talk about in this meeting.

74
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,400
 Here's who they are. And it's just super helpful to keep me up to date going into these meetings.

75
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,760
 All right. Next is my knowledge base. I am constantly on X and searching the web and reading articles

76
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,800
 all about artificial intelligence. And I wanted a single place where I can just throw everything

77
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,200
 interesting that I find into a single repository. And I'm able to use natural language to search

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,400
 against it. And again, all of the things that I'm building, I want to be able to use across

79
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,480
 different workflows. That's really important. And so when I get to the video ideation workflow

80
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,080
 later, you're going to see it actually references different articles that are that have been saved

81
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,840
 to this knowledge base. And so the way this works is I take a file or URL, I drop it in telegram,

82
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,080
 it detects the source type, extracts all the information from it, normalizes it, chunks it,

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,200
 puts it in the vector database, and then stores it. So then when I have a question like, find me all

84
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,840
 the articles about the opus 4.6 model. And so I put that user question in, it embeds it,

85
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,560
 it grabs all of the candidate articles, and then it answers with sources. So now I'm building up

86
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,040
 this infinite knowledge base of everything that has interested me and it just stores it. And I can

87
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,440
 always reference it if I'm creating a video and I want to reference a previous article, it is now

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,080
 so easy to find. Okay, next, and this is one of my favorite ones. This is the video idea pipeline.

89
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,760
 This was something that I spent a ton of time on. The way I was doing it previously is I would

90
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,280
 drop links, again, something that I'm now doing via the knowledge base into Slack to share with

91
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,360
 my team, we would talk about it in the ones that interested us the most we would decide to make a

92
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,440
 video about. Then I would create an asana card, I would do research, find all relevant articles,

93
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,520
 find relevant expos, and put it all together in that asana card. And it would just, you know,

94
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,280
 take a lot of time. But now I don't have to do any of that. So first, remember the previous

95
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,200
 knowledge base? Well, part of that workflow is when I drop an article in telegram and it gets all

96
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,800
 that information, it posts to the Slack channel for me. And it says, Hey, this is what Matt's looking

97
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,520
 at and we can have that discussion there. Also, if somebody from my team drops a link in Slack,

98
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,920
 I can actually tag my open claw and say, Hey, let's make a video idea about this. And so

99
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,400
 both of these ways work, let me show you what happens after that. So we have this idea trigger

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:43,680
 and either comes from Slack or telegram, we parse the video topic or intent. Then it does research

101
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,400
 on X and it also does research on the web. I don't know why it doesn't say that here, but it does.

102
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,320
 Then we query the knowledge base context. So it looks for potential articles that might be relevant.

103
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,560
 It comes up with video pitches and make sure it hasn't pitched us something like that already.

104
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,320
 Then it starts to build hooks in an outline for the video. It links all sources, creates that asana

105
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,880
 task and then sends confirmation to wherever I invoked it. All of this happens in like 30 seconds

106
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,120
 now super, super valuable. All right, so here's an example. In telegram, I dropped this link. So

107
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,800
 Thomas Donkey, former CEO of GitHub started a new company sounds interesting. I dropped it in here.

108
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,080
 It saved it into my knowledge base. Then it also pushed a quick summary and link to the Slack channel

109
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,640
 where we talk about all of this stuff. Then if we wanted to create a video about it, this is about

110
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,040
 a different topic, but I said, whoa, Claude short video idea. Then Claude jumps in, does a bunch of

111
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,960
 research, adds the card and everything. It's just so easy now. Now you're seeing how all of these

112
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,240
 different pieces work together to create this incredibly autonomous system that saves me a bunch

113
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,080
 of time. And by the way, if you want to see 25 more use cases, my team put together a completely free

114
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,240
 ebook all about open claw use cases, specifically how to implement them, how to get them going,

115
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,440
 why they're valuable, and so much more, go download the ebook. It's completely free. I'll drop a link

116
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,800
 in the description below. Okay, next I built out an entire workflow just for searching on Twitter

117
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,000
 because I do so many searches on Twitter, whether it's getting the data from specific posts. And

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,800
 there are so many different ways to do it. I actually built an entire fallback daisy chain

119
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,480
 system that handles it for me, and it's cost optimized. And yeah, it's amazing. Let me show

120
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,240
 you all right. So here's how it's actually working. So I actually had so I had cursor tell me exactly

121
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,320
 what's happening. So first tier one, it uses FX Twitter's API, which is apparently free. I don't

122
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,040
 really understand how it's free, but it is you can only grab individual tweets with it. Single

123
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 tweet look up only. There's no search. You can't say show me trending topics or show me topics or

124
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,200
 show me post related to this other topic. You can't do that. So fine. Then it goes to the low cost tier

125
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,720
 two, which is the Twitter API dot IO. And I'm still playing around with this. I'm kind of new to

126
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,120
 this service, but it's a relatively inexpensive way to query against Twitter. So it's 15 cents per

127
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,880
 thousand tweets. It does search profiles, user tweets, thread context, and I did grab an API for

128
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,840
 that. Then I use the expensive tier three as another fallback, the official X API V2. This is

129
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,840
 very expensive. So it's 0.005 cents per tweet, pay per use, but you get basically everything. Then

130
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:39,760
 as a fallback, we use the X AI API with the X search tool. Sometimes we use grok to search against

131
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,040
 Twitter. All of these things come together and just give me an optimized cheapest, best,

132
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,200
 fastest result. And so here's what that workflow looks like. All right. Next, obviously, I use it

133
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,320
 to track my YouTube analytics and some of my competitors are the channels that I keep a close

134
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,400
 eye on. So it hits the API daily, pulls down all of my stats for all of my videos, the channel's

135
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,920
 growth, everything, it persists it and takes a snapshot and records it in a database locally.

136
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,520
 Then it does some computations on it. And again, stores all that locally. We scan our competitors,

137
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,520
 their uploads, their cadence to see what they're doing. We get PNG charts, and then it feeds all

138
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,720
 of those insights into the meta analysis workflow, which I'll get to in a moment. And so we can kind

139
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,080
 of get a sense of which types of videos are you guys liking, what titles are working, what thumbnails

140
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,920
 are working, which are not. And it gives me recommendations all the time. All right. This next one is

141
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,640
 absolutely insane. And I actually got this idea from Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase. He said

142
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,120
 they're using AI in a really novel way where they basically plug in all of their data and have AI

143
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
 review all of it and look for gaps in their understanding of their business ways to improve.

144
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
 And I thought, Hey, we can do that. We're already collecting all this data. Let's do it. So check

145
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,760
 this out. I basically ingest all the data from my business. I put together a council of AI experts,

146
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,080
 AI agents that all work together, collaborate, and then put together a daily report for me

147
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,560
 on things that I'm missing from the business ways to improve the business and more. So first,

148
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,000
 here are all the signals. We have YouTube metrics, CRM health, chronic reliability, social growth,

149
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,040
 Slack, all the Slack messages, emails, Asana, X, Fathom meetings. That's one of the coolest ones.

150
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,880
 So Fathom, which is an AI note taker joins all my meetings, records them, transcribes them. And

151
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,240
 then I ingest that. So I have a record of all the meetings that I have. And then also my HubSpot

152
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,680
 pipeline. Then we compact it all down into the top 200 signals by confidence. And I have first a

153
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,040
 draft created. So it looks at all of these different signals and is prompted with something like,

154
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,120
 what can we do to improve the business? It's obviously a much more sophisticated prompt than

155
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,400
 that. But that's the gist. Then phase two, I have a growth strategist, a revenue guardian,

156
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,200
 a skeptical operator, and a team dynamics architect, all review it, collaborate, go back and forth

157
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,280
 with each other. They come to a consensus. I have a council moderator, again, Opus 4.6. Sorry,

158
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,600
 you can't see that. They reconciled disagreements, put it all together and finally rank everything

159
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,760
 and give me that report. That runs once a day in the middle of the night. So it's when I'm not

160
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,960
 using a lot of usage from Opus anyways. And then it provides me with that report.

161
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,200
 And it gives me great actionable insights about the business. It is super, super cool.

162
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,160
 All right. Next, I plugged in HubSpot into my open claw. And I'm not actually using this all

163
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,960
 that much, but I do allow open claw to reference my deal pipeline. And of course that's for sponsorships

164
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,400
 for this channel. And so it does have access to it. I'm not doing a lot of natural language queries,

165
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,720
 like what this is making possible. But here it is, nonetheless. So a natural language request

166
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,760
 comes in, it classifies the intent, maps to the end point, looks it all up, and then returns a

167
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,760
 summary. So I can say what deals are in my qualification stage. So kind of useful. But again,

168
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,480
 the more useful thing is just it having access to all of the deals that I'm currently working on.

169
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
 All right. Next, and this is something that I use across the board, both in my direct messages

170
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,280
 with my open claw, as well as any content it writes, it basically uses the humanizer skill

171
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,320
 against everything. And so that removes the AI smell from writing. And it's very easy. It is a

172
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,520
 skill. It's on claw hub. You can download it, install it, and it's constantly being updated

173
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,240
 with AI smells. So I have a draft input. It detects the AI writing patterns, marks the problematic

174
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,120
 spans, rewrites it, and then publishes it when it's ready. But it also just looks at everything.

175
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,240
 It's not just reactive. It's also proactive. So that's a cool one as well. All right. Next is

176
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:02,480
 image generation and also video generation. I plugged in nano banana and Vio as API's to open

177
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,000
 claw. And now it has the ability to create images and video anytime I want for any use case. So here's

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,120
 that workflow. I send it an existing image with edit instructions or I tell it what I want. All

179
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:20,000
 of this happens through telegram. I have a separate telegram topic for images and another one for video.

180
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,920
 So then it interprets it generates the images and goes back and forth until it's finally ready.

181
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,800
 Let me actually show you what that looks like. So here I just say create an icon to use in telegram

182
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,680
 to represent yourself boom. And I said make another but make it bigger and easier to see.

183
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,800
 And it did that but it's kind of horizontal format. I said make it square and boom. There it is.

184
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,760
 Very easy now. I have basically infinite image gen capability now. So I'll just say make another.

185
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,160
 And I explicitly told it rather than saving the image locally which would be on my open

186
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,680
 club MacBook Air. I said just send it to me in telegram. And here we go. Here's another one.

187
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,240
 A wonky looking one but nonetheless and knew what I was talking about. Then we also have video

188
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,640
 generation. So I said make a video and here's that. And so now I can just generate any video I need.

189
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,080
 It's so crazy. And again, these are skills that can be used in any other automation throughout

190
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,560
 open cloud. That's the key. Make them modular. Make them reusable. And you just have to tell it.

191
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,080
 Just tell it to do that. Alright, here's another one. I also have it managing my to do list. And this

192
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,560
 one is crazy. I just set this up. Alright, so there's a few ways that this can get started. One,

193
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,160
 I have a meeting. I mentioned earlier, whenever I have a video conference, I have my fathom note

194
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,720
 taker join it and transcribe all the notes. Then rather than using fathoms built in takeaway

195
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,480
 generator, which was wonky and didn't really work all that well, I take the transcript and send it

196
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,440
 to Gemini 2.5 flashlight and say, look through everything. Tell me what are key takeaways for me

197
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,600
 to do and takeaways that my attendee needs to do and record them both. Again, all of this gets

198
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,560
 stored locally. I can also just simply say, okay, add a task to follow up with X person by Friday.

199
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:17,280
 And all of it gets extracted actions, owners, deadlines, cross referenced with the CRM. Who is

200
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,280
 the person? What is the company? It looks at all of the context it has about them shows me the task

201
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,520
 list. If I approve it, it puts it into my to do list, which is the to do list app that I use.

202
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,400
 And it just manages it is so clean. And I just think the coolest part of this is that it actually

203
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,480
 will read the transcript of my meetings and automatically suggest to do's. All right, next, I started to

204
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,520
 notice because I'm doing so much with it. Occasionally, I would get charged a lot of money for an API

205
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
 caller for a model. And I wanted to keep an eye on it. I wanted to make sure that there weren't any

206
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,880
 unexpected charges. And you know, I'm still paying per month. I pay a hundred bucks per month for the

207
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,240
 cloud subscription. I pay for the Gemini API calls, the X API calls. It's not cheap. I'm probably paying

208
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,760
 about $150 per month in total for all of this, which relative to the value I'm getting from it is

209
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,240
 very cheap, in my opinion. So I have something now that tracks all of my spend and my usage.

210
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,560
 So this is something that runs silently in the background. Every single AI call, every single

211
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,800
 API call gets logged to a single place. And I can ask how much I spent this week, which workflows

212
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,880
 are costing a lot of money, show me the 30 day trend. Again, records all of it to a usage log,

213
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,880
 it queries a log gives me cost breakdowns, gives me usage breakdowns, which is just very useful for

214
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,160
 figuring out what I'm doing, maybe things that are automated and running that I didn't even know

215
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,640
 about, just keeping an eye on everything. This is very useful. All right, let me show you all

216
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,960
 of the services I'm using now. So I use Telegram, obviously, I use Slack. So that's just another

217
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,240
 surface in which I can communicate with open claw Google workspace via GOG. And that's for

218
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,120
 calendar and email ingestion, drive back up. So I'm going to get to how I save all of this,

219
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,040
 because if I lost my open claw, I would be very upset if I could not easily replicate it. I use

220
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:18,480
 Asana to do his tub spot, my YouTube API's I use X and Twitter search, Fathom, GitHub, Google drive,

221
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,120
 again, that should be included here. I don't know why it listed it twice. I use brave search for

222
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,760
 searching the web and fire crawl as well for searching the web. All right, so next, let me just

223
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,720
 show you the holistic view of all the automations I'm doing. So every hour, I sync the code repo,

224
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,080
 I check for changes, and that might be changes open claw makes to itself itself evolving. That

225
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,760
 might be changes that I'm making in cursor to it anything it checks for changes and just backs it

226
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,840
 up to GitHub. So critical, but I don't back up databases to GitHub, because that's kind of a waste

227
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,920
 to space. So instead, I have a Google drive and I save all of the databases there. I also have a

228
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,960
 very detailed document about how to restore everything in the case that I lose everything.

229
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,800
 We also check the CRM for changes. We scout for new signals from anywhere. Basically,

230
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,240
 then every single day, we're ingesting emails, we're collecting YouTube analytics, we're performing

231
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 health checks against the whole platform. And I'll explain that in a moment. And then we're

232
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,680
 doing the nightly business briefing. Every week, we synthesize daily notes into long term memory.

233
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,640
 That's something built into open claw. It's doing some housekeeping. And all of this follows the

234
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,640
 same pattern. It's using cron executes tasks, notifies me in telegram. So I have this telegram

235
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,840
 channel about all the cron jobs that run, I get a notice about them, what happened if they failed,

236
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,560
 if they succeeded. And all of that again, just gets pipes to telegram. All right,

237
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,120
 now let me talk a little bit more about the backup, because again, I don't ever want to lose this.

238
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,280
 I spent a lot of time setting it up. And so it is all tracked and get, I push all the code,

239
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,280
 including the markdown files to get it is constantly keeping track of it. And so if I ever get to a

240
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,760
 bad state, I can roll it back, although that hasn't happened. And then as I mentioned, all of my

241
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,520
 data, the databases all get backed up to Google Drive all the time, so that I'm not losing anything.

242
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,080
 So here it is, the CRM data, the analytics, the knowledge base business analysis, cron logs,

243
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,160
 everything gets backed up, time stamped, boom, Google drive. And if something goes wrong, here's

244
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,320
 how we bring it back. And the code gets put into GitHub, again, always up to date. And I have all

245
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,080
 of this running on a schedule. So it updates about every hour. Okay, next memory. How do we

246
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,680
 remember all of this stuff? Well, I'm using kind of just the default memory built in. I'm not even

247
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,400
 using QMD. And I probably should, but I haven't figured out exactly how I want to use it. So it's

248
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,880
 all pretty standard. Here's what happens during the day conversations with me tasks completed mistakes

249
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,200
 made all get piped into daily notes. Those have a weekly synthesis, it distills the patterns and

250
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,960
 preferences and gets stored into long term memory. Then we also have the learnings folder,

251
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,640
 corrective patterns mistakes, not to make again. And it just gets better over time without needing

252
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,800
 to manually do that. Alright, now let me show you how I'm actually building open claw. I know a

253
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,600
 lot of you are probably just chatting with open claw directly and having it build stuff for you,

254
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:25,360
 which is fine. But I have actually found that I prefer developing in cursor. And so there's a

255
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,240
 couple reasons for that. One, I just find the interface much easier to use. I can see the files

256
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,320
 being created. It is just built for development versus telegram, which is just a single chat window.

257
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,000
 It's just much more difficult. Again, you can do it, but I prefer using cursor. And so what I do

258
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,680
 is on my Mac studio, or again, wherever I am, I have a few different laptops, I have basically

259
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,320
 installed cursor and I SSH into the Macbook air, which open claw is on. So I have cursor SSH,

260
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,120
 I have direct SSH, and then I use team viewer, I install team viewer, if I need to really just

261
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,840
 take control of the computer completely, the Macbook air is always on, never leaves home. And I have

262
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,280
 multiple different gets that I'm using one for major projects like the CRM, and then one for open

263
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,120
 claw as a whole, I'm making new edits, everything I'm doing is mostly happening in cursor. And then

264
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,800
 I just verify it in telegram. I write tests for everything. And I am committing and pushing to

265
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,200
 GitHub frequently. All right, the last thing I want to show you is how I keep all of the markdown

266
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,720
 files up to date, because there can be a lot of drift. There are multiple different markdown

267
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,080
 files, they all do something specific. And as you're adding skills, as you're telling open claw what

268
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,200
 to do, sometimes it puts it in multiple places. Also, everything that's in the markdown files

269
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 is really dependent on the model you're using. Opus 4.6, for example, really listens to every

270
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,000
 single word that it is prompted with, you don't need to use bold, you don't need to use all caps,

271
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,160
 you don't need to say things like don't ever forget this, or make sure you do this critical.

272
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,000
 You don't need to do any of that, but that's very different from how Opus 4.5 was.

273
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,280
 So here's what I do. First, I created this workspace.md file, which specifies how everything works based

274
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,880
 on how I've implemented it. So here, the table of contents. And yes, it is a very large file,

275
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,680
 but it is a reference to be used in other places. So I have what the workspace architecture looks

276
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,760
 like. I have key patterns, SQL life for all persistent storage vector telegram. I have the platform

277
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:32,160
 configuration. I have model providers that I'm using, fallback chain plugins, et cetera, et cetera.

278
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,560
 But then we have each of these files, the agent file, the heartbeat, the identity, the memory.

279
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,080
 All of these files do something different. And so how I made sure that they stayed up to date and

280
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,320
 accurate is I had open clock go to the open clock website, download the best practices,

281
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,080
 and store them locally. And I have it always reference it. And once a day, I have it look

282
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,560
 through all of the markdown files and cross reference against the best practices and say,

283
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,360
 is there anything you need to change? Recommend things to me. Then finally, for Opus 4.6 best

284
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:12,800
 practices, I had it go and download the prompting guide for Opus 4.6. And I also stored that locally.

285
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,400
 And I also have it cross reference that. And I say, look for anything that goes against the

286
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,040
 prompting best practices provided by anthropic. And so it does this once per day and it's constantly

287
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,720
 updating itself, cleaning itself very useful. And so that's it for today. I know that was a lot.

288
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,880
 Hopefully that shows you not only what's possible, but how to get the most out of open

289
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,240
 cloth. If you enjoyed this video, please consider giving a like and subscribe. And I'll see you in the next one.
