# Complexity guardrails — prevent god functions and deeply nested logic.

# Thresholds are set above the current worst-case to avoid blocking PRs
# on pre-existing complexity. Ratchet down as code is refactored.
# For stricter per-function checks, the quality gate uses lizard
# (cyclomatic_complexity=15, length=100).
