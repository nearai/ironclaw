//! The installation-state projection (one enum, every extension;
//! `docs/reborn/extension-runtime/overview.md` §6.1).
//!
//! This enum is the host-owned installation-lifecycle vocabulary. It lives in
//! `ironclaw_host_api` — the crate every Reborn system-service and the product
//! wire already depend on — so both the `ExtensionHost` (in
//! `ironclaw_extension_host`, which re-exports this type and writes the record
//! subset `{Installed, Active, Failed}`) and the product-facing extensions wire
//! (`ironclaw_product`) name the *same* enum without a new dependency
//! edge. No extension or vendor may introduce a state, so the definition is
//! generic and nothing downstream extends it.
//!
//! It is an **honest projection**, not a durable multi-step machine. The
//! durable intent is `ironclaw_extensions::ExtensionActivationState`
//! (`{Installed, Disabled, Enabled}`); this enum is projected from that intent
//! plus active-set membership, the record's `last_error`, credential
//! completeness, and runtime support. The host persists only the working
//! subset it can prove — `Installed` (staged), `Active` (serving), and `Failed`
//! (activation failed, carries `last_error`) — while `Configured`, `Disabled`,
//! `Unsupported` are derived at projection time and `Removed` is an
//! action-response signal (removal deletes the record; it is never a resting
//! state).
//!
//! The companion auth-account state machine (§6.3) lives in `ironclaw_auth`
//! next to the engine that drives it (`ironclaw_auth::AuthAccountState`); the
//! two are re-exported together by `ironclaw_extension_host::state`.
