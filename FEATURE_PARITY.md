### P1 - High Priority
- ❌ Slack channel (real implementation)
- ✅ Telegram channel (WASM, DM pairing, caption, /start)
- ❌ WhatsApp channel
- ✅ Multi-provider failover (`FailoverProvider` with retryable error classification)
- ✅ Hooks system (core lifecycle hooks + bundled/plugin/workspace hooks + outbound webhooks)

### P2 - Medium Priority
- ❌ Media handling (images, PDFs)
- ✅ Ollama/local model support (via rig::providers::ollama)
- ❌ Configuration hot-reload
- ✅ Tool-driven webhook ingress (`/webhook/tools/{tool}` -> host-verified + tool-normalized `system_event` routines)
- ❌ Channel health monitor with auto-restart
- ❌ Partial output preservation on abort

### P3 - Lower Priority
- ❌ Discord channel
- ❌ Matrix channel
- ❌ Other messaging platforms
- ❌ TTS/audio features
- ❌ Video support
- 🚧 Skills routing blocks (activation criteria exist, but no "Use when / Don't use when")
- ❌ Plugin registry
- ❌ Streaming (block/tool/Z.AI tool_stream)
- ❌ Memory: temporal decay, MMR re-ranking, query expansion
- ❌ Control UI i18n
- ❌ Stuck loop detection

## Deviations from OpenClaw

IronClaw intentionally differs from OpenClaw in these ways:

1. **Rust vs TypeScript**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary distribution
2. **WASM sandbox vs Docker**: Lighter weight, faster startup, capability-based security
3. **PostgreSQL + libSQL vs SQLite**: Dual-backend (production PG + embedded libSQL for zero-dep local mode)
4. **NEAR AI focus**: Primary provider with session-based auth
5. **No mobile/desktop apps**: Focus on server-side and CLI initially
6. **WASM channels**: Novel extension mechanism not in OpenClaw
7. **Tinfoil private inference**: IronClaw-only provider for private/encrypted inference
8. **GitHub WASM tool**: Native GitHub integration as WASM tool
9. **Prompt-based skills**: Different approach than OpenClaw capability bundles (trust gating, attenuation)

These are intentional architectural choices, not gaps to be filled.
