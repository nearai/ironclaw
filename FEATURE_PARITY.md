| Path traversal prevention | ✅ | ✅ | Including config includes (OC-06) + workspace-only tool mounts; `realpath`-via-fd safety on agents.files.get/set |
| Credential theft via env injection | ✅ | 🚧 | Shell env scrubbing + command injection detection; no full OC-09 defense |

| Webhook signature verification | ✅ | ✅ | Padded timing-safe compare even on wrong-length signatures (Nextcloud Talk, Feishu, LINE, Zalo) |
| Media URL validation | ✅ | ❌ | Reject non-HTTP(S) inbound attachment URLs; reject remote-host `file://` URLs in webchat embedding path |

| Internal scaffolding stripping | ✅ | ❌ | `<system-reminder>`/`<previous_response>` stripped at final delivery boundary |
| Leak detection | ✅ | ✅ | Secret exfiltration |
| Dangerous tool re-enable warning | ✅ | ❌ | Warn when gateway.tools.allow re-enables HTTP tools |

| Logging redaction expansion | ✅ | ❌ | Tencent/Alibaba/HuggingFace/Replicate API keys; payment credential field names; `sk-*`/Bearer/Authorization tokens at console + file sinks |
| Trace context propagation | ✅ | ❌ | W3C `traceparent` from trusted model-call context; replaces caller-supplied values |
| Forwarded-header IP detection | ✅ | ❌ | Treat any `Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-*`/`X-Real-IP` as proxied before pairing locality checks |
| Trusted-content sanitization | ✅ | ❌ | Group/channel names rendered through fenced untrusted-metadata JSON; vCard/contact/location free-text neutralization |
| Per-tool MCP loopback policy | ✅ | ❌ | Owner-only tool visibility derived from authenticated owner-vs-non-owner bearers; no caller-controlled owner header |
| Mobile pairing TLS requirement | ✅ | ❌ | Plaintext `ws://` only on loopback; `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS` for trusted private nets |
| Webhook auth rate-limit | ✅ | ❌ | Pre-auth `429` for bad webhook secrets (Zalo, etc.) |

## Implementation Priorities

### P0 - Core (Already Done)

- ✅ TUI channel with approval overlays
- ✅ HTTP webhook channel
- ✅ DM pairing (ironclaw pairing list/approve, host APIs)
- ✅ WASM tool sandbox
- ✅ Workspace/memory with hybrid search + embeddings batching
- ✅ Prompt injection defense
- ✅ Heartbeat system
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Context compaction
- ✅ Model selection
- ✅ Gateway control plane + WebSocket
- ✅ Web Control UI (chat, memory, jobs, logs, extensions, routines)
- ✅ WebChat channel (web gateway)
- ✅ Slack channel (WASM tool)
- ✅ Telegram channel (WASM tool, MTProto)
- ✅ Docker sandbox (orchestrator/worker)
- ✅ Cron job scheduling (routines)
- ✅ CLI subcommands (onboard, config, status, memory)
- ✅ Gateway token auth
- ✅ Skills system (prompt-based with trust gating, attenuation, activation criteria)
- ✅ Session file permissions (0o600)
- ✅ Memory CLI commands (search, read, write, tree, status)
- ✅ Shell env scrubbing + command injection detection
- ✅ Tinfoil private inference provider
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible / OpenRouter provider support

### P1 - High Priority

- ❌ Slack channel (real implementation)
- ✅ Telegram channel (WASM, polling-first setup, DM pairing, caption, /start)
- ❌ WhatsApp channel
- ✅ Multi-provider failover (`FailoverProvider` with retryable error classification)
- ✅ Hooks system (core lifecycle hooks + bundled/plugin/workspace hooks + outbound webhooks)

### P2 - Medium Priority

- ❌ Media handling (images, PDFs)
- ✅ Ollama/local model support (via rig::providers::ollama)
- ❌ Configuration hot-reload
- ✅ Tool-driven webhook ingress (`/webhook/tools/{tool}` -> host-verified + tool-normalized `system_event` routines)
- ❌ Channel health monitor with auto-restart
- ❌ Partial output preservation on abort

### P3 - Lower Priority

- ❌ Discord channel
- ❌ Matrix channel
- ❌ Other messaging platforms (Yuanbao, WeCom, Google Meet, Voice Call)
- ❌ TTS/audio features (12+ providers added in OpenClaw; see Section 6 TTS/STT subsection)
- ❌ Video support (OpenRouter/MiniMax/Veo/fal/Sora)
- 🚧 Skills routing blocks (activation criteria exist, but no "Use when / Don't use when")
- ❌ Plugin registry / persisted plugin index / `git:` installs
- ❌ Streaming (block/tool/Z.AI tool_stream)
- ❌ Memory: temporal decay, MMR re-ranking, query expansion, multimodal indexing, people-aware wiki
- ❌ Control UI i18n (now 12+ locales upstream)
- ❌ Stuck loop detection
- ❌ Codex native app-server runtime + Computer Use
- ❌ Talk Mode / realtime voice (browser + backend)
- ❌ OpenTelemetry diagnostics + Prometheus exporter
- ❌ Active Memory + Skill Workshop + Trajectory export
- ❌ Outbound proxy routing + `proxy validate`
- ❌ `migrate` (Claude/Hermes import)

## Deviations from OpenClaw

IronClaw intentionally differs from OpenClaw in these ways:

1. **Rust vs TypeScript**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary distribution
2. **WASM sandbox vs Docker**: Lighter weight, faster startup, capability-based security
3. **PostgreSQL + libSQL vs SQLite**: Dual-backend (production PG + embedded libSQL for zero-dep local mode)
4. **NEAR AI focus**: Primary provider with session-based auth
5. **No mobile/desktop apps**: Focus on server-side and CLI initially
6. **WASM channels**: Novel extension mechanism not in OpenClaw
7. **Tinfoil private inference**: IronClaw-only provider for private/encrypted inference
8. **GitHub WASM tool**: Native GitHub integration as WASM tool
9. **Prompt-based skills**: Different approach than OpenClaw capability bundles (trust gating, attenuation)

These are intentional architectural choices, not gaps to be filled.
