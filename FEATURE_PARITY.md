or DB-backed ingest tenant policies for allowed consent scopes and trace-card uses with a require-policy production gate plus admin-token policy management and safe tenant-policy audit metadata, scoped export/retention/vector/benchmark worker token roles with dedicated benchmark-convert, retention-maintenance, vector-index, and utility-credit worker routes plus CLI wrappers, optional fail-closed export guardrails for explicit accepted/low-risk/consent-scoped replay, benchmark, and ranker-training corpus slices with caller-supplied export purposes plus CLI ranker `--purpose` support, tenant-policy and signed-claim allowed-use ABAC for replay/benchmark/ranker export requests, downstream source selection, process-evaluation workers, and utility-credit jobs, deployment-configurable per-request export item caps and contributor-only hourly tenant/principal submission quotas, hardened local Privacy Filter sidecar guardrails, governed delayed-credit mutation with DB-backed reviewer metadata reads and typed DB audit metadata, pending-vs-settled credit separation, idempotent benchmark/ranker candidate/ranker pair utility credit events with DB-preserved ranking utility types and terminal-trace ledger exclusion from contributor totals, and a trusted offline utility-credit worker route that appends accepted-trace regression/training/ranking utility credit idempotently without exposing reviewer_bonus or abuse_penalty, hash-chained file-backed audit rows with maintenance verification plus DB mirror hash fields, canonical audit payloads, payload hash recomputation, DB-native audit append sequencing with stale predecessor rejection, and projection-drift verification, local credit/status summaries plus authenticated web held-queue and richer credit/review activity with aggregate read-audit breadcrumbs, optional DB dual-write/backfill plus isolated per-item backfill failure reporting and a production fail-closed required DB mirror write cutover for critical submission/revocation/review/credit/export/audit/content-read rows with contributor, tenant policy, reviewer metadata, replay selection, file-side credit/audit/replay-manifest backfill repair, policy-gated DB object-ref-backed replay envelope reads with tenant/object-ref/hash verification and an object-ref-required production gate, DB-primary review decision metadata and object-ref-backed envelope reads with required non-empty decision reasons, no missing-metadata file resurrection, reviewed-envelope `review_snapshot` object refs, an object-ref-required production gate, and a dedicated benchmark/ranker source object-ref production gate before derived export publication, compact export-manifest metadata/invalidation/listing plus CLI listing, purpose-indexed reviewer trace listing, replay export item snapshots/invalidation with source object refs, audited schema-versioned benchmark conversion lifecycle metadata plus source-invalidation lifecycle revocation and a CLI lifecycle-update helper, benchmark/ranker provenance invalidation with derived, active vector, and file/service-local artifact object refs, audit reads/mirroring with reviewer queue/audit-log reads, tenant policy admin reads/writes with CLI get/set helpers, safe admin config-status reads for cutover and object-store flags, and retention/purge/revocation-tombstone invalidation reads, source-hashed exports with just-before-publish DB source revalidation, first-writer-wins hash-bearing file/DB revocation tombstones that block same-tenant re-ingest by submission id, redaction hash, or canonical-summary hash and DB-only revocation scoped to owner/reviewer principals, and per-trace replay/review plus per-source benchmark/ranker/vector content-read events including `object_ref_id` for DB object-ref reads and vector indexing, maintenance DB reconciliation with compact `blocking_gaps` and optional fail-closed clean promotion gating, derived presence/status/hash/invalid-source diagnostics, credit-ledger and canonical audit-event ID gap diagnostics, split export-manifest kind diagnostics, export item object-ref and invalid-source diagnostics, separate object-ref presence/readability/hash-mismatch diagnostics, vector index gap diagnostics, and reader-projection parity for contributor credit, reviewer metadata, analytics, audit, and export manifests, maintenance repair for already file-marked DB revocations, retention expiry maintenance with expired-source export cache pruning and explicit-purpose expired-artifact purge, vector-entry metadata/indexing with deterministic redacted-summary nearest-neighbor scoring plus encrypted redacted vector payload worker-intermediate object refs, encrypted artifact sidecar plus service-owned local encrypted object-store mode with object-primary submit/review envelope body storage, object-primary replay export reads, and object-primary benchmark/ranker derived export artifact/provenance storage, initial PostgreSQL RLS policies with transaction-local tenant context, and delayed credit notices. Not an OpenClaw parity feature. |
| `update` | ✅ | ❌ | P3 | Self-update |
| `completion` | ✅ | ✅ | - | Shell completion |
| `/subagents spawn` | ✅ | ❌ | P3 | Spawn subagents from chat |
| `/export-session` | ✅ | ❌ | P3 | Export current session transcript |

Trace Commons incremental note: reviewer quarantine and active-learning queues now surface prioritization metadata, including `review_age_hours`, `review_escalation_state`, and `review_escalation_reasons`, so CLI non-JSON output can show SLA pressure and escalation causes during triage. DB-backed review leases now let reviewer/admin principals claim or release tenant-scoped quarantined traces, expose lease assignment metadata in review queues, support `all`, `mine`, `available`, `active`, and `expired` lease filters in API/CLI/web operator queues, block other reviewers from finalizing while a lease is active, and mirror claim/release rows with typed safe audit metadata instead of empty placeholders. Analytics can now suppress aggregate cells below a configured minimum count while reporting the suppression threshold and number of hidden buckets. Tenant token entries can now carry optional RFC3339 `expires_at`/`expires` attributes, and the ingest service can accept optional HS256 signed tenant claims that bind tenant id, actor principal, role, issuer/audience when configured, allowed consent scopes/uses, and expiry without enumerating every bearer token; claim allow-lists now constrain submission, replay exports, benchmark/ranker dataset generation, process-evaluation workers, and utility-credit jobs. Keyed signed-token secrets support `kid`-selected rotation windows, deployments can cap signed-claim lifetimes by requiring `iat` and bounding `exp - iat`, require JWT IDs before accepting signed claims, emergency-denylist signed-claim JWT IDs by `jti`, and config status exposes only key/denylist/max-TTL/JTI-policy counts while submitted audit rows record only the safe auth method plus hashed principal. Retention maintenance also honors `TRACE_COMMONS_LEGAL_HOLD_RETENTION_POLICIES` so configured policy classes are skipped for new expiration and purge passes, and DB-backed maintenance runs now write durable retention job/item ledger rows for resumable expire/purge/revoke bookkeeping with admin-only API plus CLI and web-operator reads for tenant-scoped jobs and per-submission lifecycle items. Maintenance DB reconciliation now runs after the retention ledger write and reports DB retention job/item counts plus current-run retention job or item-count gaps as promotion blockers. Process-evaluation workers have a CLI submit helper for `POST /v1/workers/process-evaluation`, store bounded rubric metadata under the `process_evaluation` worker kind, mirror typed hash/count-only audit metadata, can optionally append idempotent `training_utility` delayed credit for the evaluated accepted submission using an external reference, preserve separate DB derived rows per evaluator version while feeding content-free process-evaluation analytics by label, rating, and score band without double-counting DB-backed submissions, and now require tenant policy or signed-claim evaluation-use ABAC before reading or labeling accepted trace bodies. Utility-credit workers now also require the source trace plus tenant policy or signed claim to allow the requested regression/evaluation, model-training, or ranking-training utility use before appending delayed credit. Object-primary envelope writes now use unique encrypted artifact object ids per logical snapshot so review/process-evaluation writes do not overwrite ciphertext behind older submitted-envelope object refs, terminal-trace status sync can explain retained-but-excluded delayed ledger rows without exposing them through contributor credit-event reads, web enqueue/submit and CLI queue writes reject crafted requests/envelopes that try to include message text or tool payloads disallowed by the standing policy, DB stores now reject derived rows, vector entries, and export manifest items whose object, derived, or vector refs do not belong to the same tenant/submission, periodic local credit notices now include delayed ledger deltas plus credit-event counts, CLI status sync resets credit notices when delayed-credit explanations change even without a numeric delta, and autonomous runtime capture skips ineligible current traces instead of leaving held queue files while preserving queue flush/credit notices.

## Deviations from OpenClaw

IronClaw intentionally differs from OpenClaw in these ways:

1. **Rust vs TypeScript**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary distribution
2. **WASM sandbox vs Docker**: Lighter weight, faster startup, capability-based security
3. **PostgreSQL + libSQL vs SQLite**: Dual-backend (production PG + embedded libSQL for zero-dep local mode)
4. **NEAR AI focus**: Primary provider with session-based auth
5. **No mobile/desktop apps**: Focus on server-side and CLI initially
6. **WASM channels**: Novel extension mechanism not in OpenClaw
7. **Tinfoil private inference**: IronClaw-only provider for private/encrypted inference
8. **GitHub WASM tool**: Native GitHub integration as WASM tool
9. **Prompt-based skills**: Different approach than OpenClaw capability bundles (trust gating, attenuation)

These are intentional architectural choices, not gaps to be filled.
