| Channel connection lifecycle | ✅ | ✅ | ChannelManager + WebSocket tracker |
| Session management/routing | ✅ | ✅ | SessionManager exists |
| Configuration hot-reload | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Network modes (loopback/LAN/remote) | ✅ | 🚧 | HTTP only |
| OpenAI-compatible HTTP API | ✅ | ✅ | /v1/chat/completions, per-request `model` override |

| Pre-prompt context diagnostics | ✅ | 🚧 | Token breakdown logged before LLM call (conversational dispatcher path); other LLM entry points not yet covered |
| OpenAI-compat `/v1/models`, `/v1/embeddings` | ✅ | ❌ | Discovery + embeddings on top of `/v1/chat/completions` |
| Outbound proxy routing | ✅ | ❌ | `proxy.enabled` + `proxy.proxyUrl`/`OPENCLAW_PROXY_URL` with strict http forward-proxy validation, loopback bypass; `openclaw proxy validate` |
| Diagnostics export bundle | ✅ | ❌ | Sanitized logs/status/health/config/stability snapshots for bug reports |
| Startup diagnostics timeline | ✅ | ❌ | Opt-in lifecycle/plugin-load phase tracing |
| Event-loop readiness in `/readyz` | ✅ | ❌ | Event-loop delay (p99/max), utilization, CPU ratio, `degraded` flag |
| OpenTelemetry exporter pipeline | ✅ | ❌ | Bundled `diagnostics-otel` plugin: model-call, tool, exec, outbound, context-assembly, memory pressure, harness lifecycle spans/metrics; W3C traceparent propagation; signal-specific OTLP endpoints |
| Prometheus exporter | ✅ | ❌ | Bundled `diagnostics-prometheus` plugin with protected scrape route |
| Stability snapshots / payload-free liveness | ✅ | ❌ | Default-on stability recording, event-loop delay/CPU snapshots in stability bundles |

Trace Commons incremental note: reviewer quarantine and active-learning queues now surface prioritization metadata, including `review_age_hours`, `review_escalation_state`, and `review_escalation_reasons`, so CLI non-JSON output can show SLA pressure and escalation causes during triage. DB-backed review leases now let reviewer/admin principals claim, release, claim the next available tenant-scoped quarantined trace, or claim a bounded prioritized batch through `POST /v1/review/leases/claim-next`, `POST /v1/review/leases/claim-batch`, `ironclaw traces review-lease-claim-next`, and `ironclaw traces review-lease-claim-batch`, using review escalation/SLA priority ordering before writing DB lease state and typed claim/release audit rows; they also expose lease assignment metadata in review queues, support `all`, `mine`, `available`, `active`, and `expired` lease filters in API/CLI/web operator queues, and block other reviewers from finalizing while a lease is active. Analytics can now suppress aggregate cells below a configured minimum count while reporting the suppression threshold and number of hidden buckets. Tenant token entries can now carry optional RFC3339 `expires_at`/`expires` attributes, and the ingest service can accept optional HS256 signed tenant claims that bind tenant id, actor principal, role, issuer/audience when configured, allowed consent scopes/uses, and expiry without enumerating every bearer token; claim allow-lists now constrain submission, replay exports, benchmark/ranker dataset generation, process-evaluation workers, and utility-credit jobs. Operator docs now pin production asymmetric upload-claim governance to managed issuer/key rotation with EdDSA/Ed25519, leaving static tokens and HS256 claims as internal bridge paths, and `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_EDDSA_SIGNED_TOKENS` now rejects those bridge credentials on every authenticated route when enabled. Keyed signed-token secrets and EdDSA public-key files support `kid`-selected rotation, deployments can cap signed-claim lifetimes by requiring `iat` and bounding `exp - iat`, require JWT IDs before accepting signed claims, emergency-denylist signed-claim JWT IDs by `jti`, and config status exposes only key/EdDSA-key/denylist/max-TTL/JTI-policy counts plus the EdDSA-required auth gate while submitted audit rows record only the safe auth method plus hashed principal. Retention maintenance also honors `TRACE_COMMONS_LEGAL_HOLD_RETENTION_POLICIES` so configured policy classes are skipped for new expiration and purge passes, and DB-backed maintenance runs now write durable retention job/item ledger rows for resumable expire/purge/revoke bookkeeping with admin-only API plus CLI and web-operator reads for tenant-scoped jobs and per-submission lifecycle items. Maintenance DB reconciliation now runs after the retention ledger write and reports DB retention job/item counts plus current-run retention job or item-count gaps as promotion blockers. Process-evaluation workers have a CLI submit helper for `POST /v1/workers/process-evaluation`, store bounded rubric metadata under the `process_evaluation` worker kind, mirror typed hash/count-only audit metadata, can optionally append idempotent `training_utility` delayed credit for the evaluated accepted submission using an external reference, preserve separate DB derived rows per evaluator version while feeding content-free process-evaluation analytics by label, rating, and score band without double-counting DB-backed submissions, and now require tenant policy or signed-claim evaluation-use ABAC before reading or labeling accepted trace bodies. Utility-credit workers now also require the source trace plus tenant policy or signed claim to allow the requested regression/evaluation, model-training, or ranking-training utility use before appending delayed credit. Object-primary envelope writes now use unique encrypted artifact object ids per logical snapshot so review/process-evaluation writes do not overwrite ciphertext behind older submitted-envelope object refs, terminal-trace status sync can explain retained-but-excluded delayed ledger rows without exposing them through contributor credit-event reads, web enqueue/submit and CLI queue writes reject crafted requests/envelopes that try to include message text or tool payloads disallowed by the standing policy, DB stores now reject derived rows, vector entries, and export manifest items whose object, derived, or vector refs do not belong to the same tenant/submission, periodic local credit notices now include delayed ledger deltas plus credit-event counts and a scoped durable retry outbox with safe delivery attempt hashes, CLI status sync resets credit notices when delayed-credit explanations change even without a numeric delta, and autonomous runtime capture skips ineligible current traces instead of leaving held queue files while preserving queue flush/credit notices.

This push also adds local autonomous queue diagnostics/status surfaces: CLI `traces queue-status` reports readiness, bearer-token environment presence, queue/held counts, retry/manual-review/policy hold counts, next retry time, durable flush/status-sync telemetry, retryable submission failure counters, last compaction reclaimed count, duplicate envelopes removed, orphan hold sidecars removed, malformed envelopes quarantined, sanitized held-reason counts, safe queue warning aggregates, warning severity, production-promotion blocking flags, safe recommended actions, sanitized failure classes, and local credit summaries; authenticated web `/api/traces/queue-status` reports scoped queue/held diagnostics plus the same durable telemetry, and `/api/traces/credit-notice` marks due notices. Due credit notices now carry local acknowledge/snooze state: CLI `traces credit --notice --ack` and authenticated `POST /api/traces/credit-notice` acknowledgement suppress the current credit fingerprint until credit changes, while `--snooze-hours` and the matching web action suppress it until a bounded deadline without exposing trace bodies or explanation text in the fingerprint. The agent loop now runs a periodic Trace Commons queue worker for opted-in owner/active-user scopes, stores retryable submission failures as typed redacted sidecars with capped backoff, skips retry-held envelopes until due, records durable scoped telemetry for queue/status-sync attempts, writes queue JSON through atomic temp-file replacement, compacts duplicate queued contribution envelopes and orphan held sidecars before submission, quarantines malformed active queue files locally instead of blocking later valid uploads, and broadcasts returned credit notices. Diagnostics warn on schema-version, consent-policy, redaction-pipeline, trace-card-redaction-pipeline, and malformed-envelope mismatches without raw bodies or raw observed mismatch values, and classify local failures into sanitized Endpoint, Credential, Network, NetworkOffline, NetworkDns, NetworkTimeout, NetworkConnectionRefused, HttpRejection, Policy, Queue, StatusSync, Submission, and Unknown buckets. EdDSA/Ed25519 public-key verification is available through default or `kid`-selected key config and JSON/file/guarded-HTTPS keysets with optional activation windows, with safe total/active/inactive/managed EdDSA config-status counts; managed EdDSA-required mode now accepts only active managed-keyset claims with issuer/audience checks. Autonomous clients can refresh short-lived EdDSA upload claims from guarded HTTPS issuers for queue flush, explicit submit, status sync, and remote revoke calls, and ingestion services now refresh guarded HTTPS issuer-managed Ed25519 keysets live with last-good preservation and optional max-stale fail-closed enforcement.

Trace Commons hardening note: required DB mirror mode, object refs, PostgreSQL/libSQL storage, RLS diagnostics, and encrypted artifact storage now live in the public `zmanian/tracedao-server` repo rather than Ironclaw's shared DB abstraction. Ironclaw retains local-first trace contribution capture, upload-claim fetching/validation, queue/status/credit notice behavior, and client-facing CLI/web helpers behind the Reborn-aligned `TraceClientHost` product facade for local redaction, queueing, status sync, and credit-notice delivery.

Trace Commons production-boundary note: PostgreSQL/libSQL now include a durable tenant-scoped revocation-propagation ledger for downstream invalidation and retry work across object refs, exports, vectors, derived artifacts, benchmark/ranker artifacts, credit settlements, and physical delete receipts. The revocation worker can now reverse exact tenant-scoped delayed-credit settlements with deterministic negative ledger rows, verify and physically delete exact service-local encrypted submitted/review envelope, vector worker-intermediate, benchmark artifact, and ranker export provenance object payloads for tenant-scoped object-ref items, mark matching object refs deleted, and upsert durable physical-delete receipt rows with evidence hashes, while marking unsupported stores and artifact kinds as skipped. Export call sites for replay, benchmark, and ranker slices now create and validate short-lived tenant/principal/purpose/dataset-kind access grants before producing artifacts. `TRACE_COMMONS_OBJECT_STORE=remote_service` parses production remote object-store intent but deliberately fails closed behind a disabled service-owned provider instead of falling back to plaintext files. Local autonomous status sync now keeps append-only safe history events and sanitizes server-returned credit explanations before periodic credit notices persist them, and local credit notice delivery now drains a scoped retry outbox so channel failures leave retry state instead of consuming the notice.

Trace Commons revocation-worker note: the ingest service now recognizes a scoped `revocation_worker` role and exposes `POST /v1/workers/revocation-propagation` for DB-backed propagation runs. The worker claims due tenant-scoped ledger items, performs idempotent metadata/vector/export invalidation actions, reverses exact delayed-credit settlement targets with deterministic audit-safe ledger rows, physically deletes hash-verified service-local submitted/review envelope, vector worker-intermediate, benchmark artifact, and ranker export provenance payloads for exact object-ref targets, records durable physical-delete receipt items after successful or already-recorded service-local payload deletion, records unsupported physical-delete stores/artifact kinds as explicit skipped items, preserves other tenants' due work, and emits safe audit counts.

Trace Commons vector-lifecycle note: vector indexing now writes deterministic local redacted-summary feature embeddings into encrypted service-local `WorkerIntermediate` vector payload objects while keeping relational vector rows metadata-only. PostgreSQL/libSQL storage can invalidate one vector entry for a tenant/submission/vector id, revocation propagation requires a vector-entry target for vector invalidation instead of broad accidental invalidation, and service-local vector payload deletes verify the encrypted object as a vector artifact before marking the object ref deleted and recording a physical-delete receipt.

Trace Commons export-job note: replay dataset, benchmark conversion, ranker-candidate, and ranker-pair export call sites now mirror their short-lived one-shot access grants plus running/complete export job lifecycle rows into the PostgreSQL/libSQL DB control plane. Required DB mirror mode now fails closed if a durable export job cannot be started or completed, replay exports now mark already-started DB job rows `failed` when metadata or required object-ref body reads fail before publication, benchmark/ranker exports do the same for metadata/source collection, source object-ref revalidation, and source-read audit failures before artifact publication, and tests cover tenant-scoped grant/job persistence plus replay and benchmark/ranker failure terminalization.

Trace Commons worker-export note: export-worker automation now has dedicated replay and ranker export routes, `GET|POST /v1/workers/replay-export`, `GET|POST /v1/workers/ranker/training-candidates`, and `GET|POST /v1/workers/ranker/training-pairs`, plus matching CLI helpers. These routes reuse the same consent/use ABAC, access-grant, export-job, source-hash, audit, and delayed-credit behavior as the reviewer/admin routes while keeping scheduled automation off reviewer endpoints.

Trace Commons export-control observability note: admins can now list tenant-scoped durable export access grants and export jobs through `GET /v1/admin/export/access-grants` and `GET /v1/admin/export/jobs`, with status and dataset-kind filters plus matching CLI helpers. `GET /v1/admin/operational-summary` and `ironclaw traces operational-summary` now add an admin-only, tenant-scoped aggregate rollout view for submission status/risk, review SLA pressure, DB export manifests/jobs, retention jobs, vector coverage, and delayed-credit totals. Reads are DB-backed where applicable, admin-only, tenant-scoped, and audited without exposing trace bodies.

Trace Commons tenant-access grant note: PostgreSQL/libSQL now include a durable tenant-scoped `trace_tenant_access_grants` storage surface for issuer-authorized principals, roles, consent scopes, allowed uses, issuer/audience/subject attribution, status, expiry, revocation metadata, and safe metadata. Admin-token routes and CLI helpers can create, list, and revoke the current tenant's grants while writing safe hash/count-only grant-update audit metadata, and the local `tenant-principal-ref` CLI helper derives stored static-token or signed-claim principal refs without printing raw credentials. `TRACE_COMMONS_REQUIRE_TENANT_ACCESS_GRANTS=true` now fails closed on trace submission, contributor credit/status readback, reviewer/audit reads, review mutations, dataset/export paths, non-revocation worker mutations, maintenance, and admin ledger/observability reads unless the authenticated tenant/principal has an active exact-role grant. Signed EdDSA/Ed25519 claims must also match any issuer, audience, and JWT `sub` subject bindings configured on the grant before scope/use narrowing is applied, while static-token bridge grants ignore those signed-claim-only bindings. Grant consent/use allow-lists intersect with static-token or EdDSA claim allow-lists and cannot upgrade the request role; revocation/self-delete, revocation propagation, config-status, tenant-policy admin, and grant-management routes stay available for deprovisioning and recovery.

Trace Commons issuer/TenantCtx note: the server-side `zmanian/tracedao-server` split now owns the standalone EdDSA/Ed25519-only `tracedao-upload-claim-issuer` binary that signs short-lived contributor upload claims, authenticates workload JWTs with EdDSA only, enforces workload issuer/audience/expiry plus consent/use narrowing, optionally connects to PostgreSQL/libSQL from deployment config to require DB-backed contributor tenant-access grants using the same signed-principal hash shape as ingest, rejects RSA key material, and publishes the ingest-compatible `kid`/`public_key_pem` keyset shape. The ingest compatibility layer also now fails closed when file-backed submission metadata, derived rows, credit ledger rows, audit rows, revocation tombstones, replay manifests, export provenance, or benchmark artifacts are read from one authenticated tenant directory but carry a different embedded tenant id or tenant storage ref; service-local object-ref reads/deletes also verify tenant key refs, encrypted benchmark artifact reads verify the decrypted body tenant, and vector payload deletes verify the encrypted payload body's tenant storage ref before physical deletion.

## 14. Automation

| Feature | OpenClaw | IronClaw | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Cron jobs | ✅ | ✅ | - | Routines with cron trigger; runtime state split into `jobs-state.json`; `sessionTarget: "current"`/`session:<id>` bindings |
| Reborn scheduled trigger loop | ➖ | 🚧 | P2 | Reborn-native trigger persistence, backend parity, atomic fire claim/update APIs, poller core, caller-level harness, first-party `trigger_*` capabilities, and composition-owned worker lifecycle are in progress; automation panel runs now link canonical thread ids; trigger-owned threads are openable, watchable, approvable, and cancelable by automation owners via automation-visibility authorization; scoped pause/resume/delete state transitions are available through first-party capabilities and WebUI v2 controls; first-class one-shot triggers (`TriggerSchedule::Once`, `schedule.kind = once`) are implemented (completion is derived from the schedule; the old year-pinned-cron + `completion_policy` workaround was removed); remaining follow-ups: legacy pre-fix rows without a stored thread_id remain unopenable, external result delivery, production readiness policy, active-run retention/tombstone semantics, and production jitter source selection |

## 15. Security Features

| Feature | OpenClaw | IronClaw | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Gateway token auth | ✅ | ✅ | Bearer token auth on web gateway; per-request resolution for `secrets.reload`; method-specific least-privilege scopes for CLI Gateway calls |
| Device pairing | ✅ | ❌ | Single-use bootstrap setup codes; metadata-upgrade auto-approval for shared-secret loopback; scope/role/metadata pairing approval flows |
| Tailscale identity | ✅ | ❌ | Tailscale-authenticated Control UI bypass for browser device identity |
| Trusted-proxy auth | ✅ | ❌ | Header-based reverse proxy auth; `trustedProxy.allowLoopback` |
| OAuth flows | ✅ | 🚧 | NEAR AI OAuth + Gemini OAuth (PKCE, S256) + hosted extension/MCP OAuth broker; external auth-proxy rollout still pending; OpenClaw added bootstrap-token redemption scope allowlist. Reborn `serve` now has browser SSO login for WebChat v2 (Google + GitHub; Google PKCE S256, state CSRF, cleartext-redirect guard) behind `webui-v2-beta`, with fail-closed verified-email-domain admission and per-user identity binding (distinct OAuth identity → distinct user, stateless tenant-bound HMAC session). Local-dev trigger polling also seeds admitted WebUI SSO users into trigger-fire access when enabled |
| DM pairing verification | ✅ | ✅ | ironclaw pairing approve, host APIs |
| Allowlist/blocklist | ✅ | 🚧 | allow_from + pairing store; canonical `dmPolicy="open"` only with effective wildcard across all channels |

| Cron webhook SSRF guard | ✅ | ❌ | SSRF checks on webhook delivery |
| Loopback-first | ✅ | 🚧 | HTTP binds 0.0.0.0 |
| Docker sandbox | ✅ | ✅ | Orchestrator/worker containers; opt-in `sandbox.docker.gpus` passthrough; Reborn process sandbox MVP adds typed `SandboxProcessPlan`, backend-neutral `ProcessSandboxBackend`, hardened Docker command construction, fail-closed unenforced network hosts, explicit timeout/cancel cleanup, loop-to-host `SandboxProcessPlan` validation/spawn dispatch, and a host-runtime approval/lease spawn path for `system.process_sandbox.run`; production MITM broker/product wiring still partial |
| Podman support | ✅ | ❌ | `--container` accepts both Docker + Podman |
| WASM sandbox | ❌ | ✅ | IronClaw innovation |
| Sandbox env sanitization | ✅ | 🚧 | Shell tool scrubs env vars (secret detection); Reborn process sandbox rejects sensitive raw env values in plans and uses placeholders for brokered credentials, but production secure-capture and MITM transport wiring remain partial |
| `OPENCLAW_*` env block | ✅ | ❌ | Untrusted workspace `.env` cannot inject OpenClaw runtime-control vars |
| Workspace `.env` injection blocks | ✅ | ❌ | Block `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON`, ambient Homebrew, Windows system PATH vars, `MINIMAX_API_HOST`, `npm_execpath` |

| Session file permissions (0o600) | ✅ | ✅ | Session token file set to 0o600 in llm/session.rs |
| Skill download path restriction | ✅ | ❌ | Validated download roots prevent arbitrary write targets |
| Skill installer metadata validation | ✅ | ❌ | Strict per-PM regex allowlists; URL protocol allowlist; sanitize metadata for terminal output |
| Webhook signature verification | ✅ | ✅ | Padded timing-safe compare even on wrong-length signatures (Nextcloud Talk, Feishu, LINE, Zalo) |
| Media URL validation | ✅ | ❌ | Reject non-HTTP(S) inbound attachment URLs; reject remote-host `file://` URLs in webchat embedding path |
| Prompt injection defense | ✅ | ✅ | Pattern detection, sanitization; OpenClaw added chat-template special-token stripping (Qwen/ChatML, Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Phi, GPT-OSS) |

| Leak detection | ✅ | ✅ | Secret exfiltration |
| Dangerous tool re-enable warning | ✅ | ❌ | Warn when gateway.tools.allow re-enables HTTP tools |

| Trusted-content sanitization | ✅ | ❌ | Group/channel names rendered through fenced untrusted-metadata JSON; vCard/contact/location free-text neutralization |
| Per-tool MCP loopback policy | ✅ | ❌ | Owner-only tool visibility derived from authenticated owner-vs-non-owner bearers; no caller-controlled owner header |
| Mobile pairing TLS requirement | ✅ | ❌ | Plaintext `ws://` only on loopback; `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS` for trusted private nets |
| Webhook auth rate-limit | ✅ | ❌ | Pre-auth `429` for bad webhook secrets (Zalo, etc.) |

## Implementation Priorities

### P0 - Core (Already Done)

- ✅ TUI channel with approval overlays
- ✅ HTTP webhook channel
- ✅ DM pairing (ironclaw pairing list/approve, host APIs)
- ✅ WASM tool sandbox
- ✅ Workspace/memory with hybrid search + embeddings batching
- ✅ Prompt injection defense
- ✅ Heartbeat system
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Context compaction
- ✅ Model selection
- ✅ Gateway control plane + WebSocket
- ✅ Web Control UI (chat, memory, jobs, logs, extensions, routines)
- ✅ WebChat channel (web gateway)
- ✅ Slack channel (WASM tool)
- ✅ Telegram channel (WASM tool, MTProto)
- ✅ Docker sandbox (orchestrator/worker)
- ✅ Cron job scheduling (routines)
- ✅ CLI subcommands (onboard, config, status, memory)
- ✅ Gateway token auth
- ✅ Skills system (prompt-based with trust gating, attenuation, activation criteria)
- ✅ Session file permissions (0o600)
- ✅ Memory CLI commands (search, read, write, tree, status)
- ✅ Shell env scrubbing + command injection detection
- ✅ Tinfoil private inference provider
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible / OpenRouter provider support

### P1 - High Priority

- 🚧 Slack channel (real implementation): Reborn host-beta route can be explicitly mounted by `ironclaw-reborn serve` with Slack Events API signing, DM/app-mention routing through Product Workflow/Reborn, final-reply delivery, host-state-backed personal binding pairing, WebUI v2 admin-managed allowed-channel picker, durable WebUI channel-route assignment APIs, provider-side default outbound target inventory for shared channels and explicitly provisioned personal DMs, a host-bundled Reborn extension manifest declaring the Slack ProductAdapter host API, and deterministic chat-side connect action metadata; DMs execute as the paired actor, while shared channel turns route to allowed dynamic or static channel subjects and fail closed for unrouted channels in admin-managed mode; production install/setup hardening and fuller E2E coverage remain follow-up.
- ✅ Telegram channel (WASM, polling-first setup, DM pairing, caption, /start)
- ❌ WhatsApp channel
- ✅ Multi-provider failover (`FailoverProvider` with retryable error classification)
- ✅ Hooks system (core lifecycle hooks + bundled/plugin/workspace hooks + outbound webhooks)

### P2 - Medium Priority

- ❌ Media handling (images, PDFs)
- ✅ Ollama/local model support (via rig::providers::ollama)
- ❌ Configuration hot-reload
- ✅ Tool-driven webhook ingress (`/webhook/tools/{tool}` -> host-verified + tool-normalized `system_event` routines)
- ❌ Channel health monitor with auto-restart
- ❌ Partial output preservation on abort

### P3 - Lower Priority

- ❌ Discord channel
- ❌ Matrix channel
- ❌ Other messaging platforms (Yuanbao, WeCom, Google Meet, Voice Call)
- ❌ TTS/audio features (12+ providers added in OpenClaw; see Section 6 TTS/STT subsection)
- ❌ Video support (OpenRouter/MiniMax/Veo/fal/Sora)
- 🚧 Skills routing blocks (activation criteria exist, but no "Use when / Don't use when")
- ❌ Plugin registry / persisted plugin index / `git:` installs
- ❌ Streaming (block/tool/Z.AI tool_stream)
- ❌ Memory: temporal decay, MMR re-ranking, query expansion, multimodal indexing, people-aware wiki
- ❌ Control UI i18n (now 12+ locales upstream)
- ❌ Stuck loop detection
- ❌ Codex native app-server runtime + Computer Use
- ❌ Talk Mode / realtime voice (browser + backend)
- ❌ OpenTelemetry diagnostics + Prometheus exporter
- ❌ Active Memory + Skill Workshop + Trajectory export
- ❌ Outbound proxy routing + `proxy validate`
- ❌ `migrate` (Claude/Hermes import)

## Deviations from OpenClaw

IronClaw intentionally differs from OpenClaw in these ways:

1. **Rust vs TypeScript**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary distribution
2. **WASM sandbox vs Docker**: Lighter weight, faster startup, capability-based security
3. **PostgreSQL + libSQL vs SQLite**: Dual-backend (production PG + embedded libSQL for zero-dep local mode)
4. **NEAR AI focus**: Primary provider with session-based auth
5. **No mobile/desktop apps**: Focus on server-side and CLI initially
6. **WASM channels**: Novel extension mechanism not in OpenClaw
7. **Tinfoil private inference**: IronClaw-only provider for private/encrypted inference
8. **GitHub WASM tool**: Native GitHub integration as WASM tool
9. **Prompt-based skills**: Different approach than OpenClaw capability bundles (trust gating, attenuation)

These are intentional architectural choices, not gaps to be filled.
